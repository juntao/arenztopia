## Mysterious new movie being filmed
By Tony Yuan

Natania City-Reports say that a mysterious new movie is being filmed in Natania City. When our reporters tried to visit the set, they were turned away. This movie has been shrouded in mystery since rumors got out of its development in July. There is almost nothing known about it, although most people agree that it is being produced by Naigon and Sons. Studios, a studio company based in Noi City. It is also agreed that the popular actor Ellidy J. is going to act in it. Other than that, nothing is agreed upon.

On Wednesday, the Olb City Ocelots faced off agains the Sherville Sharks in the epic last game of the 2021 Arenztopian Professional Bobsledding Season. The race was extremely close, with the Sherville Sharks losing to the Ocelots by only about 0.163 seconds. The Sherville Sharks are widely considered one of the best bobsledding teams in Arenztopia, but they were perhaps overconfident after their series of wins throughout the tournament.

## Feature: Domo Lexington
By Tony Yuan and Lorenzo Avila

Today we interviewed Domo Lexington, a famous chef working in Arenztopia City. He owns a famous restaurant there that is known for its many variations on popular dishes.

Olb City Announcer: Could you just breifly describe your restaurant?

Domo Lexington: So it's called the Lucio, after the first Doge of Venice. It's housed in an old, historic 1900 building but it features all the latest design trends inside. We use only the finest ingredients, and we cook our dishes using traditional methods.

OCA: What are some of your favorite dishes on the menu?

DL: I personally like the clam chowder with salmon steak chunks, and I also enjoy the shrimp salad with broccoli. Our most popular dish is the Chicago-style deep dish pizza with salmon, tuna, mac & cheese, and ham sausage.

OCA: That sounds delicious! What are some of the methods that you use to create your food?

DL: We have all kinds of things in the kitchen. We have two pizza ovens, one tandoori oven, three conventional ovens, a gas stove, an electric stove, and an open fire. We also have two fireplaces, one with a spit over it and one with a cauldron.

OCA: Well, that's all the questions we have today! Thanks for coming!

DL: Thank you for inviting me!
