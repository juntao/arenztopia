## Explosion at Cargo Port
By Tony Yuan

Tortoise River Freight Port-A huge explosion rocked the Tortoise River Freight Port on Tuesday. The Tortoise River Freight Port is a major port on the Tortoise River about 30 miles downstream from Olb City, at a place where the Tortoise River expands to 1000 feet. It is the output for most of the freight that is exported from Olb City. The explosion is estimated to have a blast force of 400 tons of TNT, and it destroyed ten containers and badly scorched a nearby cargo ship. The explosion killed one worker and injured two others, and it is estimated to have damaged or destroyed over 2 million Arenzos worth of cargo. Officials have quickly mobilized an investigation team. The cause of the explosion is still undetermined. We will be publishing updates as new facts emerge.

Pfizer vaccinations are at 5,500. All 5,500 Pfizer vaccinations are second shots, for a total of 523,575 fully vaccinated people. The Arenztopian Officer of Health, Dr. Johannes Peterson, says that the 20,000 doses of Moderna vaccine (see [Issue 28](https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-28/)) will be coming next week.
