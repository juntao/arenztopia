## Explosion at Cargo Port
By Tony Yuan

Tortoise River Freight Port-A huge explosion rocked the Tortoise River Freight Port on Tuesday. The Tortoise River Freight Port is a major port on the Tortoise River about 30 miles downstream from Olb City, at a place where the Tortoise River expands to 1000 feet. It is the output for most of the freight that is exported from Olb City. The explosion is estimated to have a blast force of 400 tons of TNT, and it destroyed ten containers and badly scorched a nearby cargo ship. The explosion killed one worker and injured two others, and it is estimated to have damaged or destroyed over 2 million Arenzos worth of cargo. Officials have quickly mobilized an investigation team. The cause of the explosion is still undetermined. We will be publishing updates as new facts emerge.
