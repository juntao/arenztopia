## Explosion at Cargo Port
By Tony Yuan

Tortoise River Freight Port-A huge explosion rocked the Tortoise River Freight Port on Tuesday. The Tortoise River Freight Port is a major port on the Tortoise River about 30 miles downstream from Olb City, at a place where the Tortoise River expands to 1000 feet. It is the output for most of the freight that is exported from Olb City. The explosion is estimated to have a blast force of 400 tons of TNT, and it destroyed ten containers and badly scorched a nearby cargo ship. The explosion killed one worker and injured two others, and it is estimated to have damaged or destroyed over 2 million Arenzos worth of cargo. The cause of the explosion is still undetermined.

## Coronavirus Report: Deaths are at zero!
By Owen Miyazoi

Cases have dropped even lower to 140, and deaths have dropped to ZERO for the first time since March 1st. Avac vaccination drives have increased greatly to over 500,000 people vaccinated this week. Pfizer vaccinations are at 5,500. All 5,500 Pfizer vaccinations are second shots, for a total of 523,575 fully vaccinated people. The Arenztopian Officer of Health, Dr. Johannes Peterson, says that the 20,000 doses of Moderna vaccine (see [Issue 28](https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-28/)) will be coming next week. Dr. Peterson has also said that a fresh shipment of 20,000 Pfizer vaccine doses will come next week as well, as the second replenishment shipment to Arenztopia. (The first one was delivered in secret to prevent theft.) These replenishment shipments are partially funded by the COVAX program.
