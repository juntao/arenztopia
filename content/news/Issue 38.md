## Technology Startup Releases New Phone
By Tony Yuan

6220 Main Street-On Tuesday, the Arenztopian technology startup Jupiter announced their first phone, the Jupiter III. The phone will be powered by Jupiter's own chip, the R1 Dominator, and it will have over 25 GB of storage. The III will run Jupiter's own operating system, CarbonOS, and it will be compatible with Jupiter's other devices, the Jupiter I laptop and the Jupiter II laptop, along with the JupiterWatch and JupiterPad. Jupiter held a virtual press conference on Wednesday, where they mentioned that the phone will have three large back cameras: the first one is a normal camera, the second one is a wide-angle camera with a 22-foot FOV, and the third one will be a macro camera capable of zooming to 55x. The phone will have a huge screen with a 6.5-inch diagonal, just 0.2 inches less than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. In the press conference, Jupiter also said that the phone will have two headphone jacks and be charged through a USB-A or USB-C cable. The III will have 10 hours of battery life and Jupiter's own AuthnPrint fingerprint authentication, which will be built into a black circle button on the front that is much like Apple's old home button. It will go on sale in late May for 1,300 Arenzos; preorder now through the Jupiter website at [jupiter.az/iii](https://sites.google.com/stu.austinisd.org/jupiter-az/products/iii).

## Arts

On Sunday, police raided the house of convicted Woodchuck criminal Tom McBluecal. He appears to have been the financial manager of the Woodchucks. The attic of his home had many safes with stolen money in them. There were also multiple valuable paintings; they are believed to be the products of a heist that was carried out last June at the ACAM. The paintings include works by local Arenztopian artists like Moe Kinakshi, also also by famous artists from around the world like Kandinsky, Monet, and Mondrian. The paintings were shipped back to the ACAM on Thursday.

## Sports

## Weather
By Mezoir Logan

Temperatures have leveled out at around 30 degrees Celsius, indicating the start of summer. It will be very windy from Thursday to Saturday, which will help reduce the heat a little bit.

## Coronavirus Report
By Owen Miyazoi

Cases and deaths are still at zero as vaccination speeds up. 20 million people have been vaccinated so far. Dr. Johannes Peterson, the Arenztopian Officer of Health, says that people should still wear masks and social distance because not everyone is vaccinated and we don't know if there are other asymptomatic cases. Also, President Avila has banned travel to and from India as India's case counts explode.

## Feature: Dr. Oma Toffe
By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Dr. Oma Toffe, a astrophysicist and CEO of EcoAstro, which is a space technology startup.

Olb City Announcer: Hello Dr. Toffe, thanks for coming! Could you tell us about what inspired you to become an astrophysicist?

Oma Toffe: Sure! So when I was little, I always wanted to become an astronaut: Like, I had space memorabilia everywhere, I had these big pictures of famous astronauts hung up in my room, et cetera. As I got older my interests moved more into the zone of getting someone else into space. After I graduated from the MacDuncan College of Astronomy at the Arenztopia University at Arenztopia City, I started to form a company. I made designs for the EcoAstro1, a eco-friendly space craft, which will be able to clean up trash in space.

OCA: Wow! Could you tell us about the current state of your project?

OT: Of course! Right now me and my team of 25, including five astronauts, are working on actually building my design and getting ready to execute test flights. We don't have tons of money, but we have a foundation and we have gotten grants from the Arenztopian government. If you would like to contribute, you can go to our website and upload a picture, and we will put it in the spacecraft for a fee of 10 Arenzos per picture. You can also donate to our foundation through the website.

OCA: That is very cool! Could you tell us your goal for the total amount of money?

OT: Well, to pay for the actual spaceship we need one billion Arenzos, and for the tech as well as the cleaning devices we need another half a billion, then fuel costs 3 million, plus some more money so me and my team have some extra money to use in case of emergency. So all in all, we need about 1,503,000,000 Arenzos; we've raised about a third of that.

OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions we have for you today! Thanks for coming and goodbye!

OT: Bye! It was a joy to talk to you!

## New Degree for Teachers
By Owen Miyazoi

The Officer of Education, Larsen Jinnin, has made the announcement that teachers will now have the opportunity to get a degree in teaching from the University of Arenztopia, at any of its branches. Teachers with a degree will be able to have a higher salary and other additional bonuses like increased vacation time.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the absolutely stunning science fiction trilogy, the Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. It is a captivating, vivid, and just plain excellent saga about the future of Earth. We here at the OCA personally recommend the paperback English translation from Tor.

## Obituary
By Owen Miyazoi

On Wednesday, influential philanthropist and CEO of GD & Co Parkson Illina died at the age of 93. Illina had a net worth of over 125 billion Arenzos at his peak and gave all his money away to various charitable causes. Illina made his money through smart investing: He bought 20 shares of Amazon in 1999, 100 shares of Google in 1990, and 15 shares of Apple in 1994. Illina also sourced much of his wealth from his multiple large companies like GD & Co, First National Arenztopian Bank, and Hawkson Automobile Dealers. To show sympathy, go to his website at [illina.az](https://sites.google.com/stu.austinisd.org/placeholder-site/home) or call 680-993-0213.
