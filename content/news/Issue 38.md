## Technology Startup Releases New Phone
By Tony Yuan

6220 Main Street-On Tuesday, the Arenztopian technology startup Jupiter announced their first phone, the Jupiter III. The phone will be powered by Jupiter's own chip, the R1 Dominator, and it is rumored to have over 25 GB of storage. The III will run Jupiter's own operating system, CarbonOS, and it will be compatible with Jupiter's other devices, the Jupiter I laptop and the Jupiter II laptop. Jupiter held a virtual press conference on Wednesday, where they mentioned that the phone will have three large back cameras: the first one is a normal camera, the second one is a wide-angle camera with a 22-foot FOV, and the third one will be a macro camera capable of zooming to 55x. The phone will have a huge screen with a 6.5-inch diagonal, just 0.2 inches less than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. In the press conference, Jupiter also said that the phone will have two headphone jacks and be charged through a USB-A or USB-C cable. The III will have 10 hours of battery life and Jupiter's own AuthnPrint fingerprint authentication, which will be built into a black circle button on the front that is much like Apple's old home button. It will go on sale in late May for 1,300 Arenzos; preorder now through the Jupiter website at [jupiter.az/iii](https://sites.google.com/stu.austinisd.org/placeholder-site/home).

## New Degree for Teachers
By Owen Miyazoi

The Officer of Education, Larsen Jinnin, has made the announcement that teachers will now have the opportunity to get a degree in teaching from the University of Arenztopia, at any of its branches. Teachers with a degree will be able to have a higher salary and other additional bonuses like increased vacation time.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the absolutely stunning science fiction trilogy, the Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. It is a captivating, vivid, and just plain excellent saga about the future of Earth. We here at the OCA personally recommend the paperback English translation from Tor.
