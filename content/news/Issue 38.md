## New Degree for Teachers
By Owen Miyazoi

The Officer of Education, Larsen Jinnin, has made the announcement that teachers will now have the opportunity to get a degree in teaching from the University of Arenztopia, at any of its branches. Teachers with a degree will be able to have a higher salary and other additional bonuses like increased vacation time.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the absolutely stunning science fiction trilogy, the Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. It is a captivating, vivid, and just plain excellent saga about the future of Earth. We here at the OCA personally recommend the paperback English translation from Tor.
