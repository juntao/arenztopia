## Technology Startup Releases New Phone
By Tony Yuan

6220 Main Street-On Tuesday, the Arenztopian technology startup Jupiter announced their first phone, the Jupiter III. The phone will be powered by Jupiter's own chip, the R1 Dominator, and it will have over 25 GB of storage. The III will run Jupiter's own operating system, CarbonOS, and it will be compatible with Jupiter's other devices, the Jupiter I laptop and the Jupiter II laptop, along with the JupiterWatch and JupiterPad. Jupiter held a virtual press conference on Wednesday, where they mentioned that the phone will have three large back cameras: the first one is a normal camera, the second one is a wide-angle camera with a 22-foot FOV, and the third one will be a macro camera capable of zooming to 55x. The phone will have a huge screen with a 6.5-inch diagonal, just 0.2 inches less than the iPhone 12 Pro Max. In the press conference, Jupiter also said that the phone will have two headphone jacks and be charged through a USB-A or USB-C cable. The III will have 10 hours of battery life and Jupiter's own AuthnPrint fingerprint authentication, which will be built into a black circle button on the front that is much like Apple's old home button. It will go on sale in late May for 1,300 Arenzos; preorder now through the Jupiter website at [jupiter.az/iii](https://sites.google.com/stu.austinisd.org/jupiter-az/products/iii).

On Sunday, police raided the house of convicted Woodchuck criminal Tom McBluecal. He appears to have been the financial manager of the Woodchucks. The attic of his home had many safes with stolen money in them. There were also multiple valuable paintings; they are believed to be the products of a heist that was carried out last June at the ACAM. The paintings include works by local Arenztopian artists like Moe Kinakshi, also also by famous artists from around the world like Kandinsky, Monet, and Mondrian. The paintings were shipped to the ACAM on Thursday.

By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewd Dr. Oma Toffe, a astrophysicist and CEO of EcoAstro.

Olb City Announcer: Hello Dr. Toffe, thanks for coming! Could you tell us about what inspired you to become an astrophysicist?

Oma Toffe: Hi! I've always wanted to become an astronaut. As I got older I moved to really getting someone else into space. I went to Arenztopian Tech University. As I left college I worked on my company. I made designs for the ECOAstroI, a eco friendly powered space craft, with HyperTurboEngine, with the best communication towers called ExcelTower and TDRS.

OCA: Wow! Could you tell us about your current mission?

OT: Of course! Right now me and my team of 25, including the 5 astronauts, are working on actually building my design as well as training and gettting ready to send it to space. We don't have tons of money, but we have come up with a way to make some. On out website we have made a way for you to submit a picture of anything, for the small fee of  dollars. The pictures will all be put into the space craft. We also are encouraging donations, because this is for the good of everyone. The goal of our space trip is to clean up trash in and near our atmosphere.

OCA: That is very cool! Could you tell us your goal for the total amount of money?

OT: Well, to pay for the actual ship we need 2 Billion, and for the tech as well as the cleaning devices we need another 1 billion, then fuel costs 1 million, plus money so me and my team have some money after already using all our money to put into this. So we need around 3,100,050,000 Arenzos.

OCA: That sure is alot, but with the moeny the government gave, with all the donations you have and will have plenty. Thanks for comming and goodbye!

OT: Bye!

## New Degree for Teachers
By Owen Miyazoi

The Officer of Education, Larsen Jinnin, has made the announcement that teachers will now have the opportunity to get a degree in teaching from the University of Arenztopia, at any of its branches. Teachers with a degree will be able to have a higher salary and other additional bonuses like increased vacation time.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the absolutely stunning science fiction trilogy, the Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. It is a captivating, vivid, and just plain excellent saga about the future of Earth. We here at the OCA personally recommend the paperback English translation from Tor.
