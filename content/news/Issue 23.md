The Sherville Sharks raced against the New Athens Arctic Foxes in the first game of the professional bobsledding season. The Arctic Foxes were soundly beaten by the Sherville Sharks, which comes as no surprise: The Sharks hold the record for fastest bobsled in Arenztopia (Top speed: 170 mph) and are also widely considered to be one of the best bobsledding teams in the world. Three of their team players have gotten Olympic gold medals, and they have won the last two Arenztopian Professional Bobsledding Tournaments in a row.

Hurricane Vonso suddenly decreased in intensity as it left Olb City; it is now a tropical storm. Preliminary reports say that the city suffered moderate damage, with tree branches breaking off and some shingles falling off of roofs. During the last day of Tropical Storm Vonso's passover, it brought down sleet, which means that there are also some dents in cars. The Anda Dam's gates were at full open to avoid damage from the little pieces of ice brought by the sleet, and the total causuality count is three injuries, mostly from being hit by branches and sleet. The average temperature for next week is supposed to be a cool -3 degrees.

We interveiwed Harry Taern, the CEO of trending security company Supersecure.

Olb City Announcer: So, first, what is Supersecure?

Harry Taern: Supersecure is a ultra-advanced security system that uses iris scanning to detect intruders to your home. It's also cheap and easy to install.

OCA: Can you go through each of the technologies involved in Supersecure?

HT: Sure! So first and foremost, there's the iris scan. Each person has a unique pattern in the iris part of their eyes. It's almost impossible to fake and is completely unique on everybody. So we install special security cameras that both record video and scan everybody's irises as they pass by. If it detects an unknown iris pattern, it alerts you immediately. In addition to the special iris-scanning technology, Supersecure also uses conventional security technology such as a doorbell camera and  video cameras.

OCA: That sounds interesting! How did you come up with the idea?

HT: Well, so I was reading an article about the iris-scanning technology, and I read about how easy it is to install, and how foolproof it is. And then I thought, 'Why hasn't anybody built a security company around this before?' And that was how it started.

OCA: Well, that looks like all the time we have, so bye and thanks for coming!

HT: Thank you for inviting me!

Arenztopia Tonight    
Another casualty    
of this virus    
on top of the growing heap of    
abandoned stores    
and unemployed workers.
