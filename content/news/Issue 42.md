The first and second races of the ASCRO stock car racing tournament happened on Tuesday and Wednesday. Driver Chuck Garrotte in car #49 won the first race, which was held at Canopia Speedway. Driver Lars McKaulsen in car #101 won the second race, which was held at the NACircuit in New Austin. Over the course of the two races, there was one very scary crash on the famous straightaway at the NACircuit, where Greg Ino's car #38 skidded and crashed into Thandrajen Simenkar's car #98, which sent #98 careening into the inside barrier and crumpling driver-side first. #38 flipped over and briefly burst into flames; the crash forced ASCRO officials to red-flag the race, but nobody was hurt except for Simenkar, who suffered a cut on his forehead.
