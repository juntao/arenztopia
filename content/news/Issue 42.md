By Lorenzo Avila

Tony Yuan, VP of Arenztopia, has recently been accused of many things. These things include, Fraud, being what some consider narcissistic (only a crime in Arenztopia, everyone is equal, no one is better than others.), and being mean to others (also only crime in Arentopia, direct violation of article 1 of the constitution.). Court trials will be held against Yuan, for the next 2 Fridays. Much evidence has been presented to the OCA, including pictures of Yuan's writing directly being mean to others as well as being narcissistic. Yuan has also been accused of not listening to the governement. This is a direct violation of article 2 of the Arenzish constitiution. "Citizens shall obey all laws, they shall also follow all regulations given by the government until court cases." Article 2 crime section of the Arenzish constitution. Though he is still inncocent, "Innocent until proven guilty", Yuan must still follow the regualtions. Because of this Tony will not be working on the OCA, until after 
his court case.

If Yuan is found guilty, he will no longer work for the OCA.
