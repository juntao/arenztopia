## New Dam Planned
By Tony Yuan

Shersville-On Wednesday, a new dam was announced on the Squash River about ten miles downstream from Shersville. It will be the largest dam in Arenztopia upon its completion in 2026. The dam will hold back a resovoir containing an estimated eight trillion gallons of water; the resovoir will be called Lake Shersville. The dam is a gravity dam with a length at the base of 500 feet and a height of 700 feet. The resovoir will submerge an abandoned town called Gizerh Xrgb, and Gizerh Xrgb is expected to become a hotspot for divers who want to see the abandoned and flooded city. The new dam is expected to cost six million Arenzos, and be able to control flooding and produce around 250 megawatts of energy for Shersville and other surrounding towns.

Artist Georgio Kanhalkanazzar unveiled another artwork at the OCAM called "Confusion." It is a huge canvas with a bunch of random things pasted onto it, like a picture frame, scraps of metal and paper, and even an entire bicycle.

## Sports
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

The first and second races of the ASCRO stock car racing tournament happened on Tuesday and Wednesday. Driver Chuck Garrotte in car #49 won the first race, which was held at Canopia Speedway. Driver Lars McKaulsen in car #101 won the second race, which was held at the NACircuit in New Austin. Over the course of the two races, there was one very scary crash on the famous straightaway at the NACircuit, where Greg Ino's car #38 skidded and crashed into Thandrajen Simenkar's car #98, which sent #98 careening into the inside barrier and crumpling driver-side first. #38 flipped over and briefly burst into flames; the crash forced ASCRO officials to red-flag the race, but nobody was hurt except for Simenkar, who suffered a cut on his forehead.

The beetle's scientific name is Leiodes Yvvgovus, and it has a shiny black exoskeleton and a round shape. It feeds on fungi. Their findings were published in the journal Arenztopian Entomology.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the Calvin and Hobbes comic strips by Bill Watterson. These ran in American newspapers in the 1980s and 1990s and are available in many collections. The comic strips follow the adventures of a boy named Calvin and his talking pet tiger Hobbes. They are funny, insightful, and include many assorted shenaniagans.
