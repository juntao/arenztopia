## The Life of Iloah Mai, Arenztopia's Most Successful Pacific Islander Business Owner
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

For the next 6 issues up until our 50th issue, the OCA will take you on a immersive experience of important cultural and racial moments and stories from Arenztopians past who helped Arenztopia be what it is today. Our first story is about Iloah Mai, Arenztopia's most successful Pacific Islander business owner. 

In 1931, in a cramped city apartment in Olb City, Ms. Mai was born to Ono and Maul Mai, two Pacific Islanders who had immigrated to Arenztopia from Samoa just one year before. Ono and Maul were one of the many Pacific Islanders who immigrated to Arenztopia in the 1920s and 30s.
