## Gold Mine Found!
by Tony Yuan and Clint Lee
West AM District-On Tuesday, an ancient gold mine was found in the district of West AM, known to locals as West-A-Mountain district. The gold mine was discovered by Jack Peterson, a native resident, when he was volunteering to pick up trash. Says Mr. Peterson, ¨I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, when I spotted a large hole in the hillside. I peeked in, and something shiny caught my eye.¨ Mr. Peterson immediatly called the ASO (Arenzish Scientific Office), and on Thursday the mine was revealed to be one of the biggest mines in Arenztopia´s history. Experts estimate that there could be about 500 karats of high-quality gold in the giant cavern. It is still a mystery why the miners abandoned the prosperous mine. Sadly, on Friday the mine collaped as a result of damp ground, and killed 50 people as well as 3 children. Rescuers rescued 28 more people from suffocation.
