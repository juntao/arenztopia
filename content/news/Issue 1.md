## Gold Mine Found!
by Tony Yuan and Clint Lee

West AM District-On Tuesday, an ancient gold mine was found in the district of West AM, known to locals as West-A-Mountain district. The gold mine was discovered by Jack Peterson, a native resident, when he was volunteering to pick up trash. Says Mr. Peterson, "I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, when I spotted a large hole in the hillside. I peeked in, and something shiny caught my eye." Mr. Peterson immediatly called the ASO (Arenzish Scientific Office), and on Thursday the mine was revealed to be one of the biggest mines in Arenztopia´s history. Experts estimate that there could be about 500 karats of high-quality gold in the giant cavern. It is still a mystery why the miners abandoned the prosperous mine. Sadly, on Friday the mine collaped as a result of damp ground, and killed 50 people as well as 3 children. Rescuers rescued 28 more people from suffocation.

On Saturday, a rare book was discovered among the millions of manuscripts kept in the Olb City National Library. It is a copy of the book "Bottles of Blood", which recounts the entire Arenztopian Revolution as told from the view of a young American soldier. The book was a flop, and the only two copies ever made were in this person's handwriting.
