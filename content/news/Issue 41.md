Orzolay, presented many pieces of evididence that prove he was the founder of the company. Ontay, refuses to give over the company and asks for more evidence. The court has decided that Orzolay will be given ownership of the company, as well as 5.2 Million AZ. Onytay, lacked any evidence he started the company. 1 person on jury duty called it "Embarrassing, he kept asking for evidence even after it had been provided, and he was not even capable of providing his own evidence when asked."

Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, famous owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plants seller.

Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! What is your favorite plant?

Makena DoLoa: Hi! I really like the white Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.

OCA: Sounds pretty! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist.

MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though i did not do anything.

OCA: That does sound diffucult. How much does each plant cost?

MD: Well they range in prices with the most expensive being our fig trees, with the least being our artificil succulents.

OCA: Cool! That's all the questions we had, thanks for coming!

MD: Thanks for having me!

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

## Poetry

War
all over
Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan
innocents affected
Death
Death and more Death
How lucky we are.
To have food, clean water, a place to live.
Not being terrified of bombs, and guns.
We are safe.
We are lucky.
We
Are
Free.
They
Are
Not.
