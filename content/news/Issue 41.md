On Tuesday, scientists at Olb University discovered a new type of virus called AOIVD-21, which stands for Arenztopia-Originated Intramuscular Viral Disease 2021. It has not been recorded in humans, but trials with mice and flies find that the virus spreads quickly and causes muscle spasms and seizures. "I have absolutely no idea why this hasn't been seen in humans yet, because all the signs say that it should have spread to humans by now," says Dr. Albert McPhillips, one of the researchers who discovered AOIVD-21. The researchers have published their findings in the journal Arenztopia Science.

## Poetry
By Lorenzo Avila

War    
all over    
Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan    
innocents affected    
Death    
Death and more death    
How lucky we are.    
To have food, clean water, a place to live.    
Not being terrified of bombs and guns.    
We are safe.   
We are lucky.   
We    
Are    
Free.    
They    
Are    
Not.
