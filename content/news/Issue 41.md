Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, famous owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plants seller.

Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! What is your favorite plant?

Makena DoLoa: Hi! I really like the white Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.

OCA: Sounds pretty! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist.

MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though i did not do anything.

OCA: That does sound diffucult. How much does each plant cost?

MD: Well they range in prices with the most expensive being our fig trees, with the least being our artificil succulents.

OCA: Cool! That's all the questions we had, thanks for coming!

MD: Thanks for having me!

## Poetry
By Lorenzo Avila

War

all over

Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan

innocents affected

Death

Death and more Death

How lucky we are.

To have food, clean water, a place to live.

Not being terrified of bombs, and guns.

We are safe.

We are lucky.

We

Are

Free.

They

Are

Not.
