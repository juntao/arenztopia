By Lorenzo Avila

ANG, The Arenzish News Group, is in the middle of a heated court case. Founder of the group, Onytay Unyay has been accused by Orzolay Vilay for falsely taking credit of the company. Orzolay, presented many pieces of evididence that prove he was the founder of the company. Ontay, refuses to give over the company and asks for more evidence. The court has decided that Orzolay will be given ownership of the company, as well as 5.2 Million AZ. Onytay, lacked any evidence he started the company. 1 person on jury duty called it "Embarrassing, he kept asking for evidence even after it had been provided, and he was not even capable of providing his own evidence when asked." Anonymous employees, said Onytay stole their ideas and took credit for them.
