## Science
By Owen Miyazoi

On Tuesday, scientists at Olb University discovered a new type of virus called AOIVD-21, which stands for Arenztopia-Originated Intramuscular Viral Disease 2021. It has not been recorded in humans, but trials with mice and flies find that the virus spreads quickly and causes muscle spasms and seizures. "I have absolutely no idea why this hasn't been seen in humans yet, because all the signs say that it should have spread to humans by now," says Dr. Albert McPhillips, one of the researchers who discovered AOIVD-21. The researchers have published their findings in the journal Arenztopia Science.

## Weather

## Feature: Makena DoLoa
By Lorenzo Avila

Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, the owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plant nursery. DoLoa Plants has been running for over 50 years, and it is known across the arborist world for its high quality and low prices.

Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! To start off, could you tell us your favorite plant?

Makena DoLoa: So I really, really, really like the White Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.

OCA: That sounds like a nice flower! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist?

MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though I did not do anything.

OCA: That does sound difficult. How much does each plant cost?

MD: Well, they range in prices with the most expensive being our rare flowers and large trees at about 1000 Arenzos. The least expensive are our succulents, at about 5 to 10 Arenzos.

OCA: Cool! Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today!

MD: Thanks for having me!

The famous local sushi shop Akio's Sushi is merging with Taiwan Tea, a traditional boba tea shop. The owner of Akio's Sushi, Akio Benjiro, has booked a spot for another location of his shop in the city of Verre D'eau (See story above), and since the rent is very high in Verre D'eau, Akio has merged his company with Taiwan Tea to earn more money.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we reccomend the amazing and hilarious book Thing Explainer by Randall Munroe. It explains complicated things like tectonic plates, the periodic table, microwaves, and more using only the 1000 most used words in the English language. The ridiculously funny text is accompanied by illustrations demonstrating how to disassemble a computer so that you can look inside, how not to use a telescope, and much more.

## Poetry
By Lorenzo Avila

War    
all over    
Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan    
innocents affected    
Death    
Death and more death    
How lucky we are.    
To have food, clean water, a place to live.    
Not being terrified of bombs and guns.    
We are safe.   
We are lucky.   
We    
Are    
Free.    
They    
Are    
Not.
