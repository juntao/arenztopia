## Giant Meteor Seen Over Olb City
by Tony Yuan    

Lower West Quarter-A huge meteor, dubbed HIO-20201862DDES, was seen streaking through the air in the evening on Tuesday. HIO-20201862DDES was detected by the Arenztopian satellite known as HIO. It came from the Oort Cloud and was observed in one part of its 1,534,702-year orbit, but a mysterious gravitational disruption caused it to veer onto a collision course with Earth. The meteor was estimated to be about 100 meters in diameter. It broke up in the atmosphere and several chunks caused minor damage to homes and cars. The ASA is currently studying the rock for any precious metals or signs of extraterrestrial life. One piece is to be displayed at the seasonal exhibition "Rocks of the Cosmos: A journey through the amazing world of space rocks" in 2021 at the Olb City Natural History Museum.

On Thursday, the University of Arenztopia at Natania City announced that it would be opening its stadium, Brookers Field, and it would have a football game against the New Paris Panthers.

## SEYR Foods, Inc goes bankrupt
by Owen Miyazoi

SEYR Foods, Inc, one of the largest food distributors in Arenztopia, filed for level 5 bankruptcy on Tuesday as a result of the pandemic. SEYR Foods, Inc, the food subsidary of the Argen Group, distributed 50% of the food from Nutrifood Farms last year. However, in light of the worsening pandemic, it declared a temporary shutdown last month in order to regroup its stocks and reorganize its employees. After going back on the market two weeks ago, its stocks fell another 1000 dollars, and it withdrew from the market and declared bankruptcy. The Argen Group issued a press release on Friday stating that it had received 100 million Arenzos collectively from a range of companies and funds, including Nutrifood Farms, and that it would be using this money to restart SEYR Foods and bring it back onto the market. The Argen Group also said that it would be open to receiving money until December 20th.

## Great White Shark Dies at Olb City Aquarium

## Feature: Anthony Threshdam
by Owen Miyazoi

The Announcer interviewed Anthony Threshdam, an Olb City-based engineer who invented a cheap and efficient ventilator that is saving lives across Arenztopia.

Olb City Announcer: So what got you going on this idea?

Anthony Threshdam: Well, I saw that most ventilators were extremely expensive and needlessly complicated, so I thought, "Well, why don't I invent a ventilator myself?" And I started tinkering with some machine parts that I had lying around.

OCA: Can you explain, basically, how your ventilator works?

AT: So basically, it has this little electrical motor, which drives this tiny piston, which pushes down on a bag of air and pushes air into a hose, which goes into the patient's lungs. So it's really very quite simple.

OCA: Are you proud of your invention saving lives?

TA: Yes, I certainly am. I get about a trillion e-mails every day from people who are thanking me for saving one of their family members. But it's not me they should credit, it's those people who agreed to bravely market and produce my idea. Without them, my idea wouldn't have gotten off the ground.

OCA: When did you come up with this idea and when did the ventilator start being produced?

TA: I came up with this idea about five months ago, and it started to be produced about four months ago. So, that was a pretty busy month. We got our first order, like, half a month after it started production, and the next order came a week after, then a couple days after that we started getting orders, like, every two hours.

OCA: Why is the ventilator so cheap?

TA: Well, all the parts are made of plastic, and it's really simple, and really light.

OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions we have for you right now, so bye!

TA: Bye, and thanks for having me!

This interview was slightly edited for length and clarity.
