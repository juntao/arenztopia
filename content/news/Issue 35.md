## New Territory Annexed
By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan

Choran City-A small country off the coast of Chile called the Republic of Modinau was annexed into Arenztopia on Tuesday, after money problems caused them to ask for annexation. The Republic of Modinau has now become the Modinau Region, and it has added two new large cities to Arenztopia: Choran City, their former capital, and Salnez, a large fishing town. The Modinau Region encompasses the Modinau Archipelago and is made up of seven large islands and ten small islands connected by railways plus ten miles of water in either direction. The annexation of Modinau has added about 1.5 million people to Arenztopia's population, and 4 million Arenzos to its economy. Modinau has 11 mountains, 6 of which are volcanoes. The largest is Mount Hakamu, at 2,500 feet. The largest city in Modinau is Choran City, which is located on Wakanalu Island. The largest island is Hoamu'an Island, at 75 miles wide and high. The longest nonstop rail line runs from Vallsen, in the northern island of Hakamu, to Korubanu'a City, on Ansoa Island. The former Prime Minister of Modinau, Ishakahn Makiki'a, says that he is grateful for the annexation. Mr. Makiki'a has immigrated to Arenztopia and become a politician in Olb City; he is the Old Region's ambassador to the Modinau Region.

## Arts
by Owen Miyazoi

On Wednesday, a piece by the famous Japanese-Arenztopian artist Bao Mokino was sold for over 60 million Arenzos, which is a record in Arenztopia. It is an extremely intricately carved jade boulder featuring a tranquil garden scene. Mr. Mokino has used the money to buy a building in downtown Natania City, and he says that he will refurbish it and start an art school.

## Sports
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

On Wednesday, it was declared that all professional sports players in Arenztopia had gotten vaccinated with Avac. Coach Awenhaus of the Arenztopia City Antelopes has said that he is "extremely glad that we can play professional sports again, without any players having to worry about contracting COVID-19." This new development comes right at the start of football season, with the Olb City Gladiators beating the Austerfield Atomics 24-10. The Gladiators are going to face the Arenztopia City Antelopes next week.

## Weather
By Mezoir Logan

Next week should be a warm 19 to 25 degrees Celsius, slightly cooler than last week. The winds will be optimal for flying kites at about 19 miles per hour and very steady throughout the week.

## Coronavirus Report
By Owen Miyazoi

Cases are at an all-time low of just 5, while deaths remain at 0. 10 million people have been vaccinated, and 40 million people are still waiting for the vaccine. This huge jump in vaccinations comes after a "Call to Action" by Dr. Johannes Peterson (the Arenztopian Officer of Health), and President Avila. Experts believe that we are on track to meet the goal of all adults vaccinated by May 15th.

## Feature: Akio Benjiro
By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan

This week we interviewed 63 year old Akio Benjiro, an Arenztopian-Japanese chef whose restaraunt, Akio's Sushi (アキオの寿司), has won the Saikō No Nipponshoku (SNN) Award for best Japanese restauraunt 2 years in a row for its famous and authentic sashimi and nigiri. It serves many other dishes including boba tea, ramen, and many types of sushi roll. It has two locations in downtown Olb City, one inside the Sanson Tower and a location two blocks down the street.

Olb City Announcer: Could you tell us a little bit about your life in Japan?

Akio Benjiro: Well, my home was about thirty minutes outside of Tokyo. It had a beautiful view of Mount Fuji. Every Sunday, I would drive to Tokyo and come home with many foods. I studied these foods and wrote down notes about what I liked and what I did not like while preparing them. I added many of my own ideas. After a while I wanted to start my own restaraunt. But my wife was on a vacation to Arenztopia at the time, but she had gotten sick while on the vacation, so I traveled here to care for her. My wife got better and by then I had fallen in love with Arenztopia. We decided to stay. I still had a dream to start a restaraunt, so I bought a historic two-story building here in Olb City where me and my wife lived in a small apartment on top, and ran a restaraunt below. My restaraunt started becoming more popular and I even got a proposal from the Sanson Tower.

OCA: Wow! What a great story. Could you tell us about your deal with the Sanson Tower?

AB: Sure! The owner of the Sanson Tower, Mr. Dryhesser, is a wonderful person. He offered me 200 million Arenzos to let Akio's Sushi open another location in a prime spot at the Monsai Shopping Center, located inside the Sanson Tower.

OCA: So can you tell us a little bit about your food?

AB: Yes, of course! All of my recipes are top-secret, because I have seen great sushi chefs ruined by copycats. We serve all kinds of delicious Japanese food, including ramen, sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and many other things besides. We use extremely authentic methods that my mom used and taught me when I was growing up in the 1960s.

OCA: That's really cool: I can almost taste the food now! Well, it looks like we've reached the last question that we have for you today, so thanks for coming!

AB: Thank you for inviting me! I hope you have a good day!

## Fire In East Olb City
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

On Monday, a fire occured in East Olb City which burned a house to the ground. The fire started at about noon, and burned through to 3:00 in the morning on Tuesday. The two people in the house escaped without any injury, but their pet parrot and pet dog are believed to have died. The sides of the neighbor's houses were heavily charred, but repairable. Over 500,000 Arenzos in compensation have been paid to the burned house's residents and their neighbors. The cause of the fire was revealed to be a gas leak.

## Panda Stolen
By Owen Miyazoi

Six thieves broke into a high-security enclosure at the Reserve for Conservation of Endangered Arenztopian Mountain-Inhabiting Species (RCEAMIS) on Monday and stole Bobo, the only known remaining male Arenztopian Spotted Panda. The Reserve is located inside of Tfziwrzmh Nat. Park, and the Bureau of Conservation has reported that five armed rangers were overpowered by the theives; security cameras show six dark, hooded figures hauling Bobo away in a tight and constrictive cage in the back of a pickup truck. His mate, Nomi, is pregnant with 3 children and has gone into a state of depression after Bobo was stolen. This is still breaking news; we will publish updates as new facts emerge.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

This week we recommend the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It is a wonderful book about Catniss Everdeen and the country of Panam, set in a dystopian world where people are forced to fight to the death. If you like fiction books about dystopia, this is a book for you.
