By Tony Yuan and Lorenzo Avila

Choran City-A small country off the coast of Chile called the Republic of Modinau was annexed into Arenztopia on Tuesday, after money problems caused them to ask for annexation. The Republic of Modinau has now become the Modinau Region, and it has added two new cities to Arenztopia: Choran City, their former capital, and Salnez, a large fishing town. The Modinau Region is made up of seventeen small islands connected by railways.

On Wednesday, a piece by the famous Japanese-Arenztopian artist Bao Mokino was sold for over 60 million Arenzos, which is a record in Arenztopia. It is an extremely intricately carved jade boulder. Mr. Mokino has used the money to buy a building in downtown Natania City, and he says that he will refurbish it and start an art school.
