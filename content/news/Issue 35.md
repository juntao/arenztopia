## New Territory Annexed
By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan

Choran City-A small country off the coast of Chile called the Republic of Modinau was annexed into Arenztopia on Tuesday, after money problems caused them to ask for annexation. The Republic of Modinau has now become the Modinau Region, and it has added two new cities to Arenztopia: Choran City, their former capital, and Salnez, a large fishing town. The Modinau Region encompasses the Modinau Archipelago and is made up of seven large islands and ten small islands connected by railways plus ten miles of water in either direction. The annexation of Modinau has added about 1.5 million people to Arenztopia's population, and 4 million Arenzos to its economy. the former Prime Minister of Modinau, Ishakahn Makiki'a, says that he is grateful for the annexation.

On Wednesday, a piece by the famous Japanese-Arenztopian artist Bao Mokino was sold for over 60 million Arenzos, which is a record in Arenztopia. It is an extremely intricately carved jade boulder featuring a tranquil garden scene. Mr. Mokino has used the money to buy a building in downtown Natania City, and he says that he will refurbish it and start an art school.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

This week we recommend the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It is a wonderful book about Catniss Everdeen and the country of Panam, set in a dystopian world where people are forced to fight to the death. If you like fiction books about dystopia, this is a book for you.
