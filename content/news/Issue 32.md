## New Transportation Plan Announced
By Tony Yuan

Olb City Department of Transportation-A new transportation expansion bill was announced on Monday. If passed, it will feature three new lines for the subway network, light rail service straight to and from Arenztopia Mountain National Park, a "light rail overpass" network, and more. The first new subway line will run from Olb Plaza to Olb University, with stops at Lake Oglethorpe, Villa Palenque, the Anda-Tortoise Junction, City Hall, and GD & Co HQ. The second new subway line will run from Lake Oglethorpe to Lake Maracea, with stops at City Hall, Olb Plaza, Dripping Cone, and the Sanson Tower. The third new subway line will run from the the Anda Resovoir to the Tortoise River Freight Port, with stops at the National Hospital, Lake Maracea, the Maracea River, Olb Cathedral, the Maracea-Tortoise Junction, and North Riverside. The transportation plan also includes a 250-mile expansion of the city's light rail network, which includes a light rail line running along the highway from Olb City to Arenztopia Mountain, a line following the Anda and Maracea rivers, a line following the circumference of Lake Kosan, and a light rail station and track on top of the Anda Dam. There will also be a network of "light rail overpasses", which are light rail tracks that follow roads not by going along them, but over them. These overpasses will run between the buildings, with glass bottoms to let sunlight in. Stations will be located inside of the buildings, and the overpasses will require the construction of special downward-sloping tracks inside buildings in order to let the light rail trains get back to street level. The overpasses will be the first of their kind, anywhere in the world. The entire plan is estimated to cost around 3 billion Arenzos, possibly more, and it will take until late 2022 to finish. The plan will be called the NXTransport Bill, and it will be up for a vote in June.
