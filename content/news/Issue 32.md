## New Transportation Plan Announced
By Tony Yuan

Olb City Department of Transportation-A new transportation expansion bill was announced on Monday. If passed, it will feature three new lines for the subway network, light rail service straight to and from Arenztopia Mountain National Park, a "light rail overpass" network, and more. The first new subway line will run from Olb Plaza to Olb University, with stops at Lake Oglethorpe, Villa Palenque, the Anda-Tortoise Junction, City Hall, and GD & Co HQ. The second new subway line will run from Lake Oglethorpe to Lake Maracea, with stops at City Hall, Olb Plaza, Dripping Cone, and the Sanson Tower. The third new subway line will run from the the Anda Resovoir to the Tortoise River Freight Port, with stops at the National Hospital, Lake Maracea, the Maracea River, Olb Cathedral, the Maracea-Tortoise Junction, and North Riverside. The transportation plan also includes a 250-mile expansion of the city's light rail network, which includes a light rail line running along the highway from Olb City to Arenztopia Mountain, a line following the Anda and Maracea rivers, a line following the circumference of Lake Kosan, and a light rail station and track on top of the Anda Dam. There will also be a network of "light rail overpasses", which are light rail tracks that follow roads not by going along them, but over them. These overpasses will run between the buildings, with glass bottoms to let sunlight in. Stations will be located inside of the buildings, and the overpasses will require the construction of special downward-sloping tracks inside buildings in order to let the light rail trains get back to street level. The overpasses will be the first of their kind, anywhere in the world. The entire plan is estimated to cost around 3 billion Arenzos, possibly more, and it will take until late 2022 to finish. The plan will be called the NXTransport Bill, and it will be up for a vote in June.

## Feature: Norzae Peerce
By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Norzae Peerce, a French-Arenztopian artist. His latest piece, Nuit de Lune, sold for 100 million Arenzos on the ANAS (Arenzish National Art Show.)

Olb City Announcer: Hi Norzae! Could you tell us a bit about what inspired you to make Nuit de Lune?

Norzae Peerce: Oui! I was sitting outside on my porch and there was a full moon with stars surrounding it. It was just so amazing! I had to paint it so people who did not get to see it in real life can see it in my art.

OCA: That is so beautiful! Where do you live where you can see the sky so clearly?

NP: I live in the outskirts of New Paris, I get a view of the city lights as well as the view of the sky and nature surrounding the city.

OCA: That sounds amazing! What are you planning on doing with the 100 million?

NP: Well I really have everything I need so I will probably keep a small amount for myself for food and other things but I will be donating the rest.

OCA: That is a very gracious thing to do. Thanks for coming!

NP: Thanks for having me!

The original interview was made in French. The non-translated version will be below. (Translated by Lorenzo Avila)

French Feature:

Aujourd'hui, nous avons interviewé Norzae Peerce, une artiste d'origine française. Sa dernière pièce, Nuit de Lune, s'est vendue pour 100 Million Arenzos à l'ANAS (Arenzish National Art Show.)

Annonceur d'Olb City: Salut Norzae! Pouvez-vous nous parler un peu de ce qui vous a inspiré pour faire Nuit de Lune?

Norzae Peerce: Oui! J'étais assis dehors sur mon porche et il y avait une pleine lune avec des étoiles qui l'entouraient. C'était tellement incroyable! J'ai dû le peindre pour que les gens qui ne l'ont pas vu dans la vraie vie puissent le voir dans mon art.

OCA: C'est tellement beau! Où habitez-vous où vous pouvez voir le ciel si clairement?

NP: J'habite à la périphérie de New Paris, j'ai une vue sur les lumières de la ville ainsi que sur le ciel et la nature qui entourent la ville.

OCA: Cela semble incroyable! Que comptez-vous faire avec les 100 millions?

NP: Eh bien, j'ai vraiment tout ce dont j'ai besoin, donc je vais probablement économiser une petite quantité pour moi-même pour la nourriture, entre autres, mais je vais donner le reste.

OCA: C'est une chose très gentille à faire. Merci d'être venu!

NP: Merci de m'avoir invité!
