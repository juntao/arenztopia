## Olb City Manager of Health Arrested
by Tony Yuan

City Hall-Servan Wayazoya, the Manager of Health in Olb City, was arrested and fired on Tuesday on multiple counts of tax evasion, shoplifting, and misinformation. He went on trial on Wednesday, and was found guilty of evading taxes for the entire year of 2018, shoplifting a local Walmart twice in 1998 and stealing over 1,500 Arenzos worth of goods, and spreading coronavirus conspiracy theories on Facebook. Mr. Wayazoya was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 2.5 years of community service. Olb City announced that it was looking for a new candidate for the post on Friday, and said that, due to the urgent coronavirus situation at hand, there would be an interim Manager of Health named Frank Holoneb, who is an accomplished virologist. "This shows the extent of criminal activity in the Olb City government", Mayor Yuan said on Thursday. "We will be executing a comprehensive purge of the Olb City cabinet."

## Feature: Terrayn Consan
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Terrayn Consan, the CEO of Qwarn, a social-media site, and the first transgender CEO in Olb City.

Olb City Announcer: How did you get this job?

Terrayn Consan: So Qwarn, as you may know, is an extremely progressive sort of company. So they said "Well, for our next CEO, let's get a transgender person!" and they saw me, who had a social work degree, and they were like, "Let's hire them!" and so they hired me.

OCA: What major policies have you implemented at Qwarn?

TC: I banned any type of conspiracy theory beck in 2017, and I made Qwarn the first company in the Old Region to have an all-minority board, plus a bunch of other stuff.

OCA: What are the implications of you having this post?

TC: I've seen many other transgender people become CEOs since I was hired, and I get multiple phone calls per year from people who are thanking me for inspiring them to start their own buisenesses.

OCA: Well, that's all for today! Thanks for coming!

TC: Thanks for inviting me!

This interview was edited for length and clarity.

## Beloved Tree Moved
By Owen Miyazoi

A huge poplar tree, named "Kim", gained popularity last year after it was found to be the oldest tree in Olb City, clocking in at nearly 550 years old. On Tuesday, however, the tree was carefully uprooted and moved to a new spot at a special park. The action was made after repeated requests by environmental agencies pointing out that the tree was extremely close to the factory district of Olb City, and so the new park was located 50 miles away from the factory district. The tree took two days to move and the park was officially opened in a virtual ribbon-cutting ceremony on Friday.
