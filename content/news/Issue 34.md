## Huge New Building Announced

Downtown Olb City-The engineering and architecture firm S. F. Grosby & Co. announced the building of a gigantic new skyscraper, which will cover an entire block and rise 101 stories into the sky. It will be situated on the shore of Lake Ferguson. The tower's working name is the Sky101 Tower and it will be the tallest tower in Olb City upon its completion in 2025. It will be 1,400 feet tall and will feature two revolving restaurants, a modern art museum, a mall, 32 small businesses, 1000 apartment suites, and over 750,000 square feet of office space, among other things. A render shows a majestic, twisting tower with a razor-thin top and gradual setbacks along the sides. The estimated cost is 200 million Arenzos.

## Feature: Louis Keon
By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Louis Keon, the curator of fossils at the Olb City Natural History Museum (OCNHM).

Olb City Announcer: What's the coolest thing you've ever seen at the OCHNM?

Louis Keon: Well, so I remember in 2004 I was introduced to this nice woman named Dr. Katherine Sapersky, and she had recently found this huge treasure trove of fossils, and she had brought this huge heavy-looking duffel bag. I asked her what was in the bag, and she said, "Well, nothing really, just some fossils," and she unzipped the bag and brought out this huge chunk of rock, which was literally completely encrusted in fossils: Like, I would say it was at least 85 percent fossils. And I had never seen like, 90% of them. And keep in mind, I have a PhD in Prehistoric Biology. I would estimate that there was like, literally 355 different new species in that one rock. That was about the coolest thing I've ever seen in my entire career.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Welcome to our new Book Recommendation column! In this column, we'll be publishing a recommendation for a book or series every week.

This week we recommend the series Wolves of the Beyond by Kathryn Lasky. Lasky is also the author of the bestselling Guardians of Ga'Hoole series, and Wolves of the Beyond is set in the same fantasy world. It is a captivating story about a wolf pup who is left to die because he has a splayed paw, but he inexplicably survives and goes on many adventures with his freinds. The writing is captivating and vivid. If you like Wings of Fire, Guardians of Ga'Hoole, or any other fantasy animal series, you will love this series.
