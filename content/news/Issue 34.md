## Huge New Building Announced
By Tony Yuan

Downtown Olb City-The engineering and architecture firm S. F. Grosby & Co. announced the building of a gigantic new skyscraper, which will cover an entire block and rise 101 stories into the sky. It will be situated on the shore of Lake Ferguson. The tower will be called the Sky101 Tower and it will be the tallest tower in Olb City upon its completion in 2025. It will be 1,400 feet tall and will feature two revolving restaurants, a modern art museum, a mall, 32 small businesses, 1000 apartment suites, and over 750,000 square feet of office space, among other things. A render shows a majestic, twisting tower with a razor-thin top and gradual setbacks along the sides. The estimated cost is 200 million Arenzos.
