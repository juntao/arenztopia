## Lost City Found
by Tony Yuan

Foginhaus Lake-A major scientific discovery was made on Monday when a construction crew building a new resort on the shores of Foginhaus Lake discovered an ancient Incan city. The city was encased in 15 feet of volcanic ash when Sefifad Hill, a now-extinct volcano near the site, erupted sometime around 1483. Experts predict that the ancient metropolis extends for more than a mile inland. Using SONAR, multiple temples, houses, and part of a palace have been identified. Archaeological teams have already excavated over 1,500 square meters of the city and found two human skeletons. "This was like an Incan Pompeii", John Masicim, who is the Chair of the Department of Archaeology at Olb City University, said. "We might be on the brink of a major scientific discovery that will change our understanding of the Arenztopian Incans forever."

## Autumn Starts
by Lorenzo Avila

With Autumn brings cooler weather, leaves changing colors, and of course most importantly HALLOWEEN!!! CANDY, COSTUMES, PUMPKINS. OH NO. Covid... But don't worry it may not be the same but we can still have fun. We can still have costumes, we can hold family parties, and we can still eat so much candy. So don't be sad, be excited. IT'S HALLOWEEN!!!

## Feature: Dr. Sanda Cassinoni 
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Dr. Sanda Cassinoni, a researcher from OCU who created a new variant of wheat, called Wheat-X, that is extremely weather-tolerant and nutritious.

Olb City Announcer: Could you give us an overview of the development process of Wheat-X?

Sanda Cassinoni: Sure! So at first, I was experimenting with hybrid wheats, but then I realized that the better solution was to genetically modify the wheat. I tinkered with all the parts of the DNA, and, as me and my colleagues found how to produce better and better traits, we combined them every few months, and then combined those, and the final product was Wheat-X. The first batch of Wheat-X cost two hundred thousand dollars. The second batch cost ten cents.

OCA: What traits make Wheat-X so resilient?

SC: For the most part, the weather-tolerance is caused by two proteins, EVF-6678, and HDG-4090. They pretty much tell the cells to produce more of a chemical that fortifies the wheat’s stalk and also makes the wheat grow deeper roots, which anchors the wheat to the ground better. The nutrition is caused by about a thousand proteins working together.

OCA: Which applications is Wheat-X being used in right now?

SC: So we have a foundation called the Wheat-X Foundation, and from that we have multiple programs in Africa, India, and Indonesia. 

OCA: When did Wheat-X start being produced?

SC: So it took about 5 years to develop, and then we found a company willing to grow and market it, and that was about in 2016.

OCA: That’s pretty much all! Thanks for coming!

SC: Thanks for inviting me!
