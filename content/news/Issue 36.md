Olb City Announcer: Hi, and thanks for coming! COuld you tell us what inspired you to write about World War II?

Percia Joso: Well, I grew up in post-WW2 Germany. My parents were some of the lucky Jewish people who didn't get caught by the Nazis. So I've always felt a personal connection to World War 2.

## Panda Stolen Update
By Owen Miyazoi

This is an update to a story in [Issue 35](https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-35/).

Bobo the Arenztopian Spotted Panda was found in a dumpster in Olb City a week after he was stolen from a wildlife reserve. A local resident heard noises and found the panda, thereby proceeding to call Arenztopian Animals, a nonprofit rescue organization. Bobo was returned home just in time for the birth  of his three kids, named Rori, Bielo, and Cookie. The RCEAMIS reports that Bobo and his family are very happy together, and that the panda cubs are very energetic.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

This week we recommend the excellent science book The Elements by Theodore Gray. Gray explores every single one of the elements using magnificent photos from his own vast element collection, accompanied by humorous and informative writing. Gray is also the cofounder of software company Wolfram, which makes the extremely popular software Mathematica. If you like Oliver Sacks or Randall Munroe, you will love this book.
