## Woodchuck Criminals Caught
By Tony Yuan

Olb City High-Security Jail-On Monday, police caught the infamous Woodchuck Criminals. The Woodchuck Criminals murdered three people in the space of a year, and a jury sentenced them to death by lethal injection. The details of who they are are a bit shadowy, however we have a tentative identification of John Kanhson, Tom McBluecal, and Harry Rasdin, along with Chris Owens, who was caught last year. All four have criminal histories. They pleaded not guilty but were convicted. Police were able to coax out the location of their base; it turns out that they were hiding out in an abandoned house on the outskirts of New Athens. The motive of the murders is unknown. This is still a developing story; we will publish updates as new facts emerge.

## Feature: Percia Joso
By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed 73 year old Percia Joso, the author of the new book The Adventures of Adras. The books is about a child named Adras who finds out that his parents are Nazis, and tries to escape.

Olb City Announcer: Hi, and thanks for coming! Could you tell us what inspired you to write about World War II?

Percia Joso: Well, I grew up in post-WW2 Germany. My parents were some of the lucky Jewish people who didn't get caught by the Nazis. So I've always felt a personal connection to World War 2.

OCA: I can tell the book is going to be really good. Could you tell us about the characters?

PJ: Well, the main character Adras is a smart kid with a passion for art. Every Saturday he and his best friend Joseph go to art class in Nazi Germany. On the Saturday of September 9, 1939, the teacher tells Joseph that he can't come because he's Jewish. Adras is shocked and goes home and tells his parents about what happened. His dad says, "It's for the best." Later Adras overhears his parents talking about working for the Nazis. He starts to plan to escape because he knows being a Nazi is wrong, and that night he escapes with Joseph, some Jewish neighbors, and the Jewish neighbors' baby. The rest of the story is them trying to make it to England.
 
OCA: I better go buy this book right now. Where can I get a copy?

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

This week we recommend the excellent science book The Elements by Theodore Gray. Gray explores every single one of the elements using magnificent photos from his own vast element collection, accompanied by humorous and informative writing. Gray is also the cofounder of software company Wolfram, which makes the extremely popular software Mathematica. If you like Oliver Sacks or Randall Munroe, you will love this book.
