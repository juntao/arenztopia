## Submarine Wreck Found
By Tony Yuan

Arville-On Tuesday, the wreck of the submarine ASMV (Arenztopian Submersible Marine Vehicle) Northerner was found approximately 20 miles off the coast of Arville. The submarine was built in 2000 and was the largest submarine ever built in Arenztopia and also the ninth-largest submarine at 450 feet long. The Northerner was also the first and only nuclear-powered submarine built in Arenztopia. It had a capacity of 100 people and a top speed of 25 knots or 31 mph. In 2008, the Northerner experienced an electrical failure during a training exercise and was unable to regulate the pressure inside the hull, leading to an immediate implosion which killed every single one of the 95 people on board. Miraculously, the nuclear reactor itself was able to evade any major damage, but the nuclear waste room has been steadily leaking small amounts of radiation into the sea around the wreck. Locating the submarine became a very high priority for the Arenztopian Navy and other naval-related groups in order to stop the radiation leak. In 2010, explorer Hadring Leon reached the wreck and shared a description of its condition, but he never shared where the wreck was located and died suddenly soon after his discovery. So, despite multiple expeditions, the location of the wreck of the Northerner has been an enduring mystery for eleven years. The wreck was rediscovered by a joint team led by the Arenztopian Navy and the Mariner's Association of Arenztopia (MAA), using three ships, the AMV (Arenztopian Marine Vehicle) Baltika, AMV Amundsen, and AMV Wiencke, all working together to comb a roughly 50-square-mile area that had been narrowed down by earlier expeditions. "This was the largest expedition to locate the ASMV Northerner in history," said the expedition's director, Johans Korenson. "The expedition was originally scheduled for July 2020 but it had to be postponed due to the coronavirus." The ships had set sail from Arville Port last month and they were beginning to lose hope when the crew of the AMV Wiencke spotted a spike in radiation levels and also detected a jagged formation protruding from the seafloor. The AMV Baltika and AMV Amundsen immediately sailed to the AMV Wiencke and indeed confirmed higher-than-usual radiation levels and also some kind of wreckage on the seafloor. The divers Rodney Alkun and Julian Tiberun dived to the seafloor and indeed confirmed that the wreckage was that of the Northerner. "I will never forget that moment when I was swimming around in the wreckage and saw those white letters spelling 'ASMV NORTHERNER' jump out at me from the darkness of the ocean," says Julian. Plans are underway to lift the wreckage out of the ocean and possibly transport it to a museum.

On Monday, scientists at the University of Arenztopia at Olb City discovered a new species of tree in the National Forest. The tree's scientific name is Pinus Lajareni, after Tash Lajaren, the well-known Arenztopian arborist. This species is distingished by its long needles, high-up branches, and grayish bark. The scientists' findings were published in the journal Arenztopian Arborology Journal on Friday.
