The Sculptor's Association of Arenztopia (SAA) announced its dissolution on Thursday, after a scandal which caused the resignment of prominent artists like Bao Mokino, Moe Kinakshi, Miekl Kyonankii, and others. The CEO of the association, a classical-style artist named Sinclair Yindranishikan, was found to be a member of the Classicist Revolutionaries, which attacked Miekl Kyonankii's studio a couple months ago (See [Issue 24](https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-24/)). Due to his endorsement of the Classicist Revolutionaries, Yindranishikan had broke the SAA's rules against prejudice. In addition, Yindranishikan was among the people found guilty of breaking and entering into Kyonankii's studio. He was sentenced to a year in jail.

By Owen Miyazoi    

Cases remain at zero, with vaccinations slowing. About 41,000,000 people have been vaccinated, with nine million still to go. Many of those nine million are children, because Avac has not been approved for children 16 and under. Dr. Johannes Peterson, the Officer of Health, has ordered around a million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved for children 12 and over.

## Feature: Minoshi Conaway
By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Minoshi Conaway, a racecar driver for ASCRO car #33, sponsored by Kaiath Systems. #33 was involved in a huge and famous crash at Olb Speedway in 2018, where Conaway lost control of his car and did a barrel roll, crashing into and setting on fire several other cars. Two people were killed in the crash and it led to a reform of the ASCRO rules.

Olb City Announcer: Hello! To start off, can you tell us a bit about the famous crash in 2018?

Minoshi Conaway: Sure! So I clearly remember that the crash was very sudden, because one moment I was pulling into the lead and then the next moment my car was spinning and on fire, right?
