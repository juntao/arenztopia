The Sculptor's Association of Arenztopia (SAA) announced its dissolution on Thursday, after a scandal which caused the resignment of prominent artists like Bao Mokino, Moe Kinakshi, Miekl Kyonankii, and others. The CEO of the association, a classical-style artist named Sinclair Yindranishikan, was found to be a member of the Classicist Revolutionaries, which attacked Miekl Kyonankii's studio a couple months ago (See [Issue 24](https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-24/)). Due to his endorsement of the Classicist Revolutionaries, Yindranishikan had broke the SAA's rules against prejudice. In addition, Yindranishikan was among the people found guilty of breaking and entering into Kyonankii's studio. He was sentenced to a year in jail.

On Wednesday, the Chanlanian Cheetahs lost to the Arenzish Atmospheres as the soccer season continues. The Arenzish Atmospheres are expected to go against the Olb City Opossums in the finals next week.

## Science
By Owen Miyazoi

Welcome to our new Science column! In it, we will report science news from around Arenztopia.

On Tuesday, researchers at Olb University successfully demonstrated an experimental rocket engine being developed for the ASA. They fitted it onto a General Rocketry 118 rocket and launched it from Indanburg Air Force Base near New Austin. The rocket reached 115 miles in altitude and made 20 orbits before making a controlled reentry over the Arenztopian desert. The ASA said that the test was a success, and that they may be attempting to launch a satellite using the engine next month.

## Coronavirus Report
By Owen Miyazoi    

Cases remain at zero, with vaccinations slowing. About 41,000,000 people have been vaccinated, with nine million still to go. Many of those nine million are children, because Avac has not been approved for children 16 and under. Dr. Johannes Peterson, the Officer of Health, has ordered around a million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved for children 12 and over.

## Feature: Minoshi Conaway
By Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Minoshi Conaway, a racecar driver for ASCRO car #33, sponsored by Kaiath Systems. #33 was involved in a huge and famous crash at Olb Speedway in 2018, where Conaway lost control of his car and did a barrel roll, crashing into and setting several other cars on fire. Two people were killed in the crash and it led to a reform of the ASCRO rules.

Olb City Announcer: Hello! To start off, can you tell us a bit about the famous crash in 2018?

Minoshi Conaway: Sure! So I clearly remember that the crash was very sudden, because one moment I was pulling into the lead and then the next moment my car was spinning and on fire, right? So my first thought was literally "OMG OMG What is going on" and then I looked outside of my window and saw that there were a bunch of sirens and fire and yelling, so I thought "Well, this is bad," and at that point my car crashed into the barrier and I blacked out. And this was all in the space of maybe six seconds, so it was all very intense and abrupt.

OCA: So what is your theory about why you lost control and caused the crash?

MC: Well, my theory is that I was going a bit too fast, because I was pulling into the lead, which means I need to go fast, but I was also turning, which means that I needed to go a bit slower to avoid losing control. I incorrectly chose the former option, and that cost two people their lives, so I am eternally regretful for that.

OCA: Could you tell us a bit about your career before and after the crash?

MC: So my career before the crash was actually pretty good, I had won multiple races already, and I already had a bit of a reputation for going too fast, and people were saying, "Conaway is gonna get into a huge crash someday," but nobody thought that it was going to be so soon. After the crash, I competed in exactly three races, and I got first place in one of them and second place in the other two. And then I retired at the end of the 2018 season, and now I run a foundation called Azra to provide support for people who were injured in racing accidents.

OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today! Thank you for coming!

MC: Thank you for inviting me! It was a joy to talk to you!
