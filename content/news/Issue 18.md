## Famous Athlete Missing
by Tony Yuan

Marifu Hills-Famous soccer player Luke Jasil went missing on Wednesday. Police say he disappeared from his home at night. Officials think that he was kidnapped. The OCPD has published five suspects on its website at [ocpd.org/suspects](ocpd.org/suspects). "This is an act of grevious cowardice," Jack Carter, the leader of the Olb City Detective Association, said in a statement. Forensic scientists have roped off Jasil's home and are searching for evidence. In a statement, they said that they had found several incomplete fingerprints, but not enough to determine the kidnapper. Police have also speculated that the kidnapping was motivated by Jasil's intense opposition of the Science party.

## Arts

A new tapestry was unveiled for the growing and trending exhibit at the OCAM, Weaving Magic. It is billed as "The largest tapestry in Olb City!" and that is actually true. The gargantuan, whose actual title is "Woodland Scene with Deer and Rabbits," was weaven by renowned tapestry artist Pedro Sacala in 1735. At 75 feet by 50 feet, it took 10 years to compete and was previously stored at the Arenztopia City Museum of Art.

## Feature: Gerel Farnor
by Tony Yuan

We interviewed Gerel Farnor, the director and CEO of the Arenztopian Society of Doctors.

Olb City Announcer: What is special about the ASD?

Gerel Farnor: The ASD is a huge society, about 10,000 members, and the special thing about it is that it's composed completely of ICU front-line workers, and it's the only doctors' society in Arenztopia to be composed entirely of ICU doctors.

OCA: Could you breifly explain the history of the ASD?

GF: Sure! So, in 1908, when we were founded, there was a doctor named Dermaul K. Loughton, and he was an ICU doctor and thought that some ICU doctors weren't getting paid as much as they should be for how much their front-line work meant to the community, so he created a doctor's union which eventually evolved into the ASD.

OCA: How have these doctors helped with the COVID relief effort?

GF: Well, since the number of COVID cases is comparably low, the doctors in some of the places with less COVID cases are actually pretty fine, they're not stretched to the limit. However, in the places with more cases, such as New Athens and Austerfeild, since about a third of COVID cases end up in the ICU in Arenztopia, those doctors have more patients than usual in their ICUs, and they're trying their best, and so far, over 200 people with COVID have recovered nationwide under the care of ASD doctors.

OCA: Well, that's it for today, and thanks for coming!

GF: Thank you! I hope to see you again soon!
