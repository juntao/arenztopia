## Nogateny Stosgat loses 38 billion Arenzos
By Tony Yuan

Arenztopian Stock Market-Famous billionare Nogateny Stosgat (See [Issue 5](arenztopia.com/news/issue-5)) lost almost 38 billion Arenzos overnight as two of his companies, TechDaily Magazine and Stosgat Industries, experienced a stock drop of over 100 billion Arenzos on Tuesday. The 38 billion Arenzos are a huge chunk of Mr. Stosgat's 90 billion Arenzo fortune. Mr. Stosgat had been warned by investors not to invest such a large amount in stocks, but he ignored them and bought a 33% stock in Stosgat Industries and a 25% stock in TechDaily. Stosgat also owns 1,100 BCions, a cryptocurrency, which also took a big hit on Tuesday. Reports say that Stosgat no longer has enough money to pay the mortgage on his gargantuan, 600,000 square foot mansion at his private beachside resort near Canopia. We are unsure what steps he will take next, and we will publish updates as new details emerge.

Countdown.

11 days until it was...
1 year since covid put us in quarantine.
Wow.
