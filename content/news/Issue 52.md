## Major Changes Announcement
## Recently, we were forced to lay off several people because of lack of funding. Because of the shortage of people, we've decided to temporarily cut the Feature section, the Poetry column, and the Book Recommendation column. We are sincerely sorry for whatever inconveniences this may cause to you.
