Today we interviewed Meilleur GÃ¢teau Acel, owner of Acel's Bakery in the predominantly french neigborhood in New Paris. 

Olb City Announcer: Hi! Thanks for being here! Could you tell us about the history of your bakery.

Meilleur G. Acel: Yea, well my grandmother started the buisness as a small bakery just out of town in 1950 after Arenztopia became a US territory. She was amazing! When i was little she taught me alot. She passed when I was 10 but my mom continued to teach me. From that time until now, me and my mom run the restaraunt together. My dad passed away of cancer before i was born, so we use the profits to donate to Medicine Center atArenztopian University.

OCA: I am so sorry for your losses, could you tell us about Dripping Cone.

## Mummy Tomb Found
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

On Tuesday, famous archaeologist Ishaan P. discovered a tomb built in the Ancient Egyptian style hidden underneath the Arenztopian Desert. The tomb contained two mummies, a room with many expensive books, and another, hidden room with over 5 million Arenzos worth of gold. The mummies are believed to be that of a wealthy Arenztopian landowner named Abasi Adel and his wife. They famously requested to be mummified in 1924 at the height of the European mummy craze. Abasi had his mummy buried in a previously secret location known only to him, his wife, and the contracting company employed to dig it.

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the excellent article "I Recommend Eating Chips" by Sam Anderson for the New York Times. It is funny and amplifies the experience of eating chips into a true literary masterpiece.
