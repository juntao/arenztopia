## Luke Jasil Kidnapping Mystery Solved!
By Tony Yuan

8930 Wensal Lane-Private investigator Sai G. has solved the long-standing mystery of the presumed kidnapping of famous soccer player Luke Jasil. The culprit was determined to be 59 year old Frederick Winston. According to the OCPD, Winston was illegally smuggling wine and alcohol by hiding it in Pringles cans. Winston was also convicted of stealing caviar from multiple luxury stores and also hiding it in Pringles cans. Since Jasil lives close to Winston's house, one day while Jasil was going on a run he saw Winston drinking wine out of a Pringles can. Jasil wrote a letter to Winston inquiring about the strange sight, and shortly after, he was kidnapped. Jasil was found in a state of delerium in Winston's neighbor's house; it seems that Winston's neighbor was also a collaborator in the wine-smuggling operation. Both people have been sentenced to 367 years in prison on three hundred and forty five charges of wine and alcohol smuggling, two hundred charges of shoplifting, and one charge of kidnapping.

## Feature: Meilleur Acel
By Lorenzo Avila & Tony Yuan

Today we interviewed Meilleur Gâteau Acel, owner of Acel's Bakery in New Paris. It achieved some degree of fame in the cooking community on Monday when it won the coveted 1st place award on the French baking competition show GPF. Mr. Acel is also known for his famous 2013 deal with Dripping Cone, in which he became the first small business to collaborate with the ice cream giant.

Olb City Announcer: Hi! Thanks for coming! Could you tell us a bit about the history of your bakery?

Meilleur Acel: Sure! So it all started when my grandmother decided to open a bakery in New Paris, after she had immigrated there from France in the 1950s. She was a truly amazing chef! Whenever I wandered past the kitchen while she was cooking, she would drag me over and show me how to bake bread from scratch, weather I wanted to have a cooking lesson or not. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away when I was 13, and from then on my mom taught me. My dad had passed away of cancer only two months before I was born, so we donate 25% of our bakery's profits to cancer research at the Department of Medicine at Arenztopia University.

OCA: I am so sorry for your losses, could you tell us a bit about your famous deal with Dripping Cone?

MA: 

OCA: Cool! What is your favorite dessert you make at the bakery?

MA: The Étonnante Choclate Cake, for sure. We make an espresso and dutch dark chocolate cake, with liberal amounts of our secret-recipe chocolate syrup. Then once it is out of the oven and cooled, we top it with our famous chocolate frosting, our hand-made chocolate truffles and strawberries sourced from local farms.

OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions we have for you today! Thank you for coming!

MA: Thank you for inviting me!

## Mummy Tomb Found
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

On Tuesday, famous archaeologist Ishaan P. discovered a tomb built in the Ancient Egyptian style hidden underneath the Arenztopian Desert. The tomb contained two mummies, a room with many expensive books, and another, hidden room with over 5 million Arenzos worth of gold. The mummies are believed to be that of a wealthy Arenztopian landowner named Abasi Adel and his wife. They famously requested to be mummified in 1924 at the height of the European mummy craze. Abasi had his mummy buried in a previously secret location known only to him, his wife, and the contracting company employed to dig it.

## G. B. MacEmhoff's Personal Records Released
By Owen Miyazoi

The personal records of famous media and oil magate Gaylord Brownings MacEmhoff, more commonly known as G. B. MacEmhoff, were finally released by the government after the allotted time of 50 years for prominent historical figures. MacEmhoff was an Irish-American who immigrated to Arenztopia and made a previously unknown but gigantic amount of money wildcatting in the Arenztopian Desert and investing in the stock market. He was convicted of fraud in 1970 and the American government siezed all of his personal property the following year, before turning it over to the Arenztopian government in 2020. The records show the true extent of his wealth, the amount of money lost in the vast fraud that he sponsored, and the extent of his estate. His net worth peaked in 1947 at over 50 billion Arenzos; he frauded people out of 23 billion Arenzos; and his estates covered a total of 12,890 square acres. 

## Book Recommendation
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

Today we recommend the excellent article "I Recommend Eating Chips" by Sam Anderson for the New York Times. It is funny and amplifies the experience of eating chips into a true literary masterpiece. You can read it [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/magazine/i-recommend-eating-chips.html), but you'll have to bypass the paywall somehow.
