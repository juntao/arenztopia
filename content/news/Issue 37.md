## Mummy Tomb Found
By Sam-Louis Alrocaet

On Tuesday, famous archaeologist Ishaan P. discovered a tomb built in the Ancient Egyptian style hidden underneath the Arenztopian Desert. The tomb contained two mummies, a room with many expensive books, and another, hidden room with over 5 million Arenzos worth of gold. The mummies are believed to be that of a wealthy Arenztopian landowner named Abasi Adel and his wife. They famously requested to be mummified in 1924 at the height of the European mummy craze. Abasi had his mummy buried in a previously secret location known only to him, his wife, and the contracting company employed to dig it.
