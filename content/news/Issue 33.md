Today we interviewed Dominique Motul, a Colombian-Arenztopian scientist, he and his company recently discovered a new microorganism that bunches together to eat other microorganisms. They believe the microorganism to be a very dangerous thing and may harm humans. 

Olb City Announcer: Hi! Dominique, I am going to start off with what all of our readers are wondering, should we be worried about this organism?

Dominique Motul: No, not really. The microorganism, which we named Staphylococcus Bacillales, can only grow in temperatures under 0 degrees F. 

OCA: Thats a relief! How would it harm humans?

DM: Well, as well as eating other organisms it also eats plant and human cells, it can start decaying our body eventually getting inside and it can carry disease.

OCA: That is creeepy! Where is it most likely to grow?

DM: In places with some sort of living things to feed on and very cold weather.

OCA: Well, thanks for coming!

DM: Thanks for inviting me!
