<p>This section is your one-stop shop for information about Arenztopia. It includes all that you ever need to know about Arenztopia.</p>
<h2 id="general-guide">General Guide</h2>
<p>The Arenztopian Island resides off the coast of Mexico. The President is Lorenzo A., Ruler Of the Country Of Arenztopia, and he lives in Arenztopia City, which is located next to the Bay of Arenztopia at the southeast corner of the island. The 50 million people on the island enjoy a plentiful economy of $5 trillion and lots of beautiful cities. The major cities are Arenztopia City, Olb City, Noi City, Austerfield, Arville, Shersville, New Austin, Sitin, New Rome, Choran City, and Salnez. Symbols of Arenztopia include a horse (the national animal) and ice cream, (national food). The people speak Arenzese, English, and Spanish. Mount Arenztopia is the highest spot, at an astounding 20,100 feet. On the contrary, the lowest point is in the Arenztopian Desert at 200 feet below sea level. The country's motto is &ldquo;We love books&rdquo;, but the more commonly used version is the Arenzese, &ldquo;Dv Olev Yllph.&ldquo;The currency of Arenztopia is called the Arenzo. One Arenzo is equal to 50 cents USD. All stores will accept it, and most people use it. It is unique in that it is completely digital-no paper bills or coins involved.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.theproblemsite.com/reference/mathematics/codes/backwards-alphabet-code">free Arenzese translator</a>. You type English into the box, press &ldquo;encode&rdquo;, and it'll translate into Arenzese.</p>
<p>Arenztopia is home to many cities. Arenztopia City is the largest, at nearly 2 million people in population, and there are many semi-autonomous city-states within Arenztopia, which are called Rohadden, Iremdor, and Aradakon, which are tax-free entities. They are areas that did not agree to the 2020 American Treaty and so became their own semi-autonomous entities. The smallest city is Cuyanting, with a population of just 2,500 people.</p>
<h2 id="politics">Politics</h2>
<p>This section explores the political alignment and structure of Arenztopia.</p>
<h3 id="political-structure">Political Structure</h3>
<p>There is a President, who is voted into place, and who follows a constitution. The Vice President is also voted into place and will become the new interim president in wake of the president suddenly resigning or dying. There are also 2 judges in the Supreme Court, and two senators. The judges function much like the Supreme Court of the USA, handling high-level cases and approving laws. The senators propose laws and perform other executive duties. Finally, the Executive Branch, consisting of the President, the Vice President, and the advisors, organizes the political ecosystem and keeps things in order, as well as making top-level desicions and passing laws. There is also a House of Representatives, which contains one representative from every state and region. They represent the state's intentions and propose bills. Every term for every position is two months, except for the president, who has a unlimited term.</p>
<p>There are two main parties:</p>
<p>The Ethics Party, which values ethics over science. For example, if killing an animal is necessary for an experiment, as long as the animal is not absolutely necessary to the experiment, an Ethics person will not kill it. However, Ethics people are not vegetarians, because they think that animals can be eaten.</p>
<p>The Science Party, which values science over ethics. A Science person will kill an animal even if it is not absolutely necessary to an experiment or scientific process.</p>
<p>All independents are grouped into the Red Party.</p>
<p>Laws are approved by this process: First, a group of citizens or a politician proposes a bill. If the bill is on a level lower than national, the citizens in the area that is affected by the bill vote on it. If it wins the vote, the leaders of the affected area review it again, then the bill is approved and passed into law. If the bill affects the entire nation, it goes to the senate. The senators look at the bill and make sure that it is reasonable and can be implemented, and if the bill is passed, it goes to the Executive Branch. The President, the advisors, and the Vice President look over the bill and see if it improves the situation of the country and if it fits the interests of the people. After that, the bill goes to the Judicial Branch, which are the judges, who make sure that it is constitutional, then they will officially pass the bill into law.</p>
<h3 id="political-alignment">Political Alignment</h3>
<p>Arenztopia is a military and economics ally to the numerous city-states within it, and also to the USA, Japan, France, England, Germany, China, Mexico, Italy, Vatican City, and Canada.</p>
<p>Arenztopia does not have any enemies yet, except for the short-lived chaos organization Chickentopia and the now-defunct terrorist group Milestopia.</p>
<h2 id="media">Media</h2>
<p>The main media group in Arenztopia is the AMG, Arenztopia Media Group, which is an association that includes APR (Arenztopia Public Radio), ARB (Arenztopia Royal Broadcasting), ATV (Arenztopia TV), ATN (Arenztopia Television Network), and ANN (Arenztopia News Network).
APR is the central radio station in Arenztopia. It has stations, such as QAXR and NRTX, in every city in Arenztopia.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This is a comprehensive guide to the history of Arenztopia.</p>
<h3 id="history-section-i-colonization-and-timeline">History Section I: Colonization and Timeline</h3>
<p>This section has  comprehensive overviews of all of the civilizations that have colonized the Arenztopian Island at one point or another.</p>
<h4 id="history-part-1-the-incas">History part 1: The Incas</h4>
<p>In the year 1470, the great Incan emperor Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui sent a fleet of ships out from Cusco to explore new lands. The explorers, after venturing for about 500 miles out from shore, ran headfirst into a gigantic storm. It wrecked 3 of their ships and killed a dozen men, and the remaining people were forced to turn back. About a week later the brisk gale powered their crafts to a mysterious island. This island was Arenztopia, but the Incans called it Puquna Wat'a Pachacuti, which meant &ldquo;Fertile soil island of Pachacuti&rdquo;. Arenztopia was born.</p>
<h5 id="incan-rule">Incan Rule</h5>
<p>This storm is called the Tlwh&rsquo; Yovhhrmt (gods&rsquo; blessing) in the folk tales. But the real gods&rsquo; blessing for these weary Incan travellers was the extremely fertile soil their scouts reported. Legend has it that the leader of the expeditionaries fell to his knees and said &ldquo;Agradiseyki Inti, chaypas nogakuna munay llapa tiyay hamchi!&quot;(a rough translation of praise Inti* for we will all be saved!) and started sobbing. The men made a large offering, and then gratefully planted wheat, maize, and potatoes that they had brought along on their boat while some people set out to notify the emperor. Over the next 60 years the emperor visited several times and Arenztopia was built up into a bountiful asset. Then, sixty-three years after that fateful storm-the Tlwh&rsquo; Yovhhrmt-Francisco Pizzaro came along and felled the mighty Inca Empire.</p>
<p>Spanish rule had begun.</p>
<p>*Inti was the king of the gods in the Inca empire.</p>
<h4 id="history-part-2-the-spanish">History part 2: The Spanish</h4>
<p>In 1533, the last emperor of the Incan Empire, Atahualpa, was brutally executed by Francisco Pizzaro, and the island of Arenztopia was turned over to the rapidly expanding Spanish Empire. The king of Spain at that time, Charles V, took note of this vast island added to his gigantic pan-European and South American empire and so he paid a trip to Arenztopia in 1535. He was awed at the beautiful scenery, fertile land, and unprecedented riches, and he decided to build a huge, grand ranch in Arenztopia. Then, in 1558, Charles died. The new king, Philip II, ignored Arenztopia except as a distant, overseas colony. Arenztopia fell into decline during the reigns of the next three kings, and it became a poor, farming community with few people and even less money. Then, during the reign of Philip V, everything changed. Philip revitalized Arenztopia, pumping money into the community and introducing more people. He embarked on a series of grand urban planning projects and founded many large cities, such as Canopia and Natania City. Over the next 200 years, Arenztopia flourished under Spanish rule. Then, during Alfonso XIII's rule, a geurilla group came over from Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico and conquered Arenztopia single-handedly in the Arenztopian Revolution. Arenztopia was now American.</p>
<h4 id="history-part-3-the-americans">History part 3: The Americans</h4>
<p>In 1935, Arenztopia was formally annexed to the United States of America in the midst of the Great Depression by Franklin D. Roosevelt. President Roosevelt opted to make Arenztopia a semiautonomous territory of the USA, instead of a state, so that Arenztopia wouldn't be totally reliant on America during the Great Depression. Arenztopia became a minor battlefront for World War II when the Japanese tried to conquer it in the Pacific Theatre, reaching as far inland as the middle of the Arenztopian Desert before being beaten back by American troops. Arenztopia prospered under American rule for 85 years until 2020, when a treaty allowed Arenztopia to become its own independent nation.</p>
<h4 id="history-part-4-modern-arenztopia">History part 4: Modern Arenztopia</h4>
<p>After signing a treaty with the USA in 2020 allowing it to have independence, the citizens of Arenztopia started to create a government and elect a president. In March 2020, the War of Chickentopia occured, when Arenztopia warred against the chaos organization known as Chickentopia. In April 2021, Arenztopia annexed a small group of islands off the coast of Chile called the Modinau Archipelago. You can read more about modern Arenztopia in the other parts of this website.</p>

<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Arenztopia is a reasonably large island roughly 2,000 miles off the coast of Mexico. In the west, it has mainly grassland and some forest. In the central part, it has a desert and a large forest. Near the northern and southern tips of the island are two tall mountains, Arenztopia Volcano and Arenztopia Mountain. In the east, there is a large mountain range called the <a href="https://www.arenztopia.com/tourism/#national-parks">Tfziwrmh</a>, and some hilly terrain dotted with some forests. In the north there are some more mountains and more hills, with several large patches of grassland.</p>
<p>Several major rivers and deltas exist in Arenztopia.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arenztopia River is the largest river in Arenztopia. It runs through the heart of Arenztopia City and continues inland, where it feeds several lakes and wetlands.</li>
<li>The Tortoise River flows through Olb City and meets the Chrysanthemum River at the largest delta in Arenztopia to form one of the largest river systems in Arenztopia.</li>
<li>The Chrysanthemum River feeds several mountain lakes on Arenztopia Mountain. It shares a delta with the Tortoise River where the two rivers meet the sea.</li>
<li>The Hernandez River is an extremely long river that waters the National Forest and reaches a little bit into the Arenztopian Desert.</li>
<li>The Cattle River feeds a massive floodplain in the Coast Region. It forms a long river system with the Glass River.</li>
<li>The Glass River feeds two very large lakes and meets the Cattle River at a third lake.</li>
<li>The Marsh River feeds a large bog in the Coast Region. Outflows from this bog help water the National Forest. The Marsh River also forms a river system with the Hernandez River.</li>
<li>The Squash River forms one of the longest river systems in Arenztopia with the Prairie River. This river system helps water the vast grasslands of Uivrmw.</li>
<li>The Prairie River is the only river in Arenztopia which does not have a delta where it meets the sea. It forms a river system with the Squash River.</li>
</ul>
