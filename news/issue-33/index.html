<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>Dr. Johannes Peterson, the Arenztopian Officer of Health, decreed on Monday that every professional sports player in Arenztopia should get Avac by the end of the week, so several hundred doses of Avac were set aside for &ldquo;Operation SportVax&rdquo;. According to a survey by the polling company Naloaf, over 99% of professional players have gotten Avac after Operation SportVax, with only about a dozen people left.</p>

<p>By Mezoir Logan</p>
<p>The weather next week is going to be near-perfect spring weather, with temperatures from 21 degrees Celsius to 24 degrees Celsius. There should be a 30% chance of rain on Friday as clouds move in Thursday night.</p>
<h2 id="feature-dr-dominique-motul">Feature: Dr. Dominique Motul</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan, based on an original document by Lorenzo Avila</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Dr. Dominique Motul, a Colombian-Arenztopian scientist. His laboratory team is stationed at the Descalvure Laboratory at Olb University and they beleive that they have found a new species of bacteria that exhibits virus-like properties: invading cells, devouring tissue, and using the body's functions to make more of itself. Dr. Motul also says that the bacteria can devour other bacteria by grouping together into a team. The microorganism is believed to be extremely dangerous to humans.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi, Dr. Motul! I'm going to start off today with what I'm sure many of our readers are wondering: Should we be extremely worried about this organism?</p>
<p>Dr. Dominique Motul: No, not really. The microorganism, which we named Staphylococcus Bacillales, can only grow in temperatures over 51 degrees Celsius, which is roughly 125 degrees Farenheit; and with a very high humidity index over 65%.</p>
<p>OCA: That's a relief! How would it harm humans?</p>
<p>DM: Well, it can result in sudden death, rotting, and disappearance of large areas of flesh; it can devour many beneficial bacteria that we rely on; and it can make flesh and skin turn black and fall off. It can also cause the failure of many important organs, which in most cases causes extensive internal bleeding; and it can also make substantial parts of your brain stop working. I'm serious about all of this; we in the laboratory have taken to calling it the &ldquo;Death Specter Bacterium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OCA: Oh my god! That sounds extremely gruesome! I think we're extremely fortunate that it's very uncommon in the world. Can you tell us how you made the discovery?</p>
<p>DM: Sure! So last month, I was messing around with the humidity and heat in these petri dishes full of living tissue, as part of an experiment on rotting and development of bacteria, and one day I was really bored so I prepared a fresh petri dish and turned the humidity up really high, and then I maxed out the heat. To my suprise, when I came back the tissue was blackened and in the early stages of rot. I looked at it through a microscope, and realized that there was a huge amount of bacteria all over the tissue, and that's normal. But then I looked closer and realized that it was all the <em>same type</em> of bacteria. That's when I knew that I had discovered something truly special.</p>
<p>OCA: Well, those are all the questions we have for you! Thanks for coming!</p>
<p>DM: Thanks for inviting me!</p>
<p>This interview was edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>Dr. Motul's findings were published in the journal Science on Tuesday, in collaboration with Sigrryb F. Hamsen, Knils M. Tearlach, and Gwynneth S. Traehrednuht.</p>

<p>By Lorenzo Avila, edited by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>On Tuesday, three people were reported missing; their bodies were found in a Dumpster the next day. The Dumpster had the words &ldquo;The Woodchucks are Coming&rdquo; scrawled in red on the side. Police think that the murderers are the same people who killed two people one year ago. (See <a href="https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-1/">Issue 1</a>) Famous private investigator Sai G. has been put on the case. All information is valuable: If you have any info, please call the OCPD's Woodchuck Hotline at 650-WOOD-CHUCK.</p>

<h2 id="obituary">Obituary</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the famous Mexican-Arenztopian politician Adrastos Callis passed away at the age of 84. He was an extremely influential advocate of Mexican-Arenztopian and Mexican-American rights in the 1970s. He was a close ally of President Lorenzo Avila and donated much of his earnings to charity. Please send your regrets to Mrs. Callis at 650-722-2864.</p>
