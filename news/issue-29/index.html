<h2 id="nogateny-stosgat-loses-38-billion-arenzos">Nogateny Stosgat loses 38 billion Arenzos</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Arenztopian Stock Market-Famous billionare Nogateny Stosgat (See <a href="arenztopia.com/news/issue-5">Issue 5</a>) lost almost 38 billion Arenzos overnight as two of his companies, TechDaily Magazine and Stosgat Industries, experienced a stock drop of over 100 billion Arenzos on Tuesday. The 38 billion Arenzos are a huge chunk of Mr. Stosgat's 90 billion Arenzo fortune. Mr. Stosgat had been warned by investors not to invest such a large amount in stocks, but he ignored them and bought a 33% stock in Stosgat Industries and a 25% stock in TechDaily. Stosgat also owns 1,100 BCions, a cryptocurrency, which also took a big hit on Tuesday. Reports say that Stosgat no longer has enough money to pay the mortgage on his gargantuan, 600,000 square foot mansion at his private beachside resort near Canopia. We are unsure what steps he will take next, and we will publish updates as new details emerge.</p>

<h2 id="feature-kankalon-ongarimnieo">Feature: Kankalon Ongarimnieo</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Kankalon Ongarimnieo, the founder of the popular eatery Two Knives Arenztopia.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: So what are some of your signature dishes?</p>
<p>Kankalon Ongarimnieo: We serve more progressive, inventive, and interesting dishes, such as calamari sushi with freshly harvested banana hash.</p>
<p>OCA: What tools do you use to make your food?</p>
<p>KO: We use a variety of special tools to make our dishes as authentic as possible. We use brick ovens, tandoori ovens, conventional ovens, stoves, open-air pit fires, fryers, and blowtorches.  For our chocolate, we first put the cocoa beans into a tango drum, then we roast the drum, then we perform the rest of our secret chocolate-making process.</p>
<p>OCA: That sounds very interesting! Where do you source yur ingredients from?</p>
<p>KO:</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that's all for today, and thanks for coming!</p>
<p>KO: Thank you for inviting me! It was a joy to talk to you!</p>
