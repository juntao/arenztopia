<h2 id="giant-flood-occurs">Giant Flood Occurs</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Hasiania-On Friday, the city of Hasiania was devastated by a large flood occurring from a combination of heavier-than-usual rain and the seasonal flooding of the Jubilant River, a tributary of the Arenztopia River. &ldquo;The Jubilant River usually floods much less than this,&rdquo; says Gary Unhardt, a local weatherman. &ldquo;Usually it floods only about half a mile inland, but this time it's flooded half a dozen miles inland.&rdquo; Downtown Hasiania has been completely flooded to a height of three and a half feet, and over three dozen people have been reported dead and another hundred and fifty or so are missing. &ldquo;There's never been anything like this in the entire history of Hasiania, ever,&rdquo; says Joe Regal, a local data analyst. Help has come to Hasiania from all sides of Arenztopia: The ALERT (Arenztopia nationaL Emergency Response Team) has sent 500 people and 250 search-and-rescue boats to Hasiania, and the Arenztopian Coast Guard has sent several helicopters and 100 search-and-rescue boats to scour the city. This is still a developing story; we'll publish updates in next week's paper as new facts emerge.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, one of celebrated Arenztopian painter Priscilla Selan's paintings was turned into an NFT (Nonfungible token) as a publicity stunt. NFTs are digital things like images, videos, and tweets that are all individually unique and owned by one person, like a trading card: If you trade a Babe Ruth baseball card for another Babe Ruth baseball card, then the baseball card that you have now will not be the same as the first one, just like if you trade an NFT of a picture of a cat eating a pizza for another NFT of a picture of a cat eating a pizza, you will have a different NFT as the first one. Priscilla's NFT painting was actually specially created for the occasion. Titled &ldquo;Internet,&rdquo; it features a really fat cat eating a pizza, and it sold for 1.5 million Arenzos on Wednesday to an anonymous buyer.</p>

<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>For the next 6 issues up until our 50th issue, the OCA will take you on a immersive experience of important cultural and racial moments and stories from Arenztopians past who helped Arenztopia be what it is today. Our first story is about Iloah Mai, Arenztopia's most successful Pacific Islander business owner.</p>
<p>In 1931, in a cramped city apartment in Olb City, Iloah Mai was born to Ono and Maul Mai, two Pacific Islanders who had immigrated to Arenztopia from Samoa just one year before. Ono and Maul were one of the many Pacific Islanders who immigrated to Arenztopia in the 1920s and 30s. Iloah was one of the first Pacific Islanders to go to the University of Arenztopia at Olb City. After she graduated from business school at the age of 22, Iloah had big ambitions.</p>

<p>Today we recommend the excellent Five Kingdoms series by Brandon Mull. The series follows the fantastical adventures of a boy named Cole as he explores the Five Kingdoms, a magical realm full of dangers. The series is captivating, descriptive, and really just plain awesome.</p>
