<h2 id="giant-flood-occurs">Giant Flood Occurs</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Hasiania-On Friday, the city of Hasiania was devastated by a large flood occurring from a combination of heavier-than-usual rain and the seasonal flooding of the Jubilant River, a tributary of the Arenztopia River. &ldquo;The Jubilant River usually floods much less than this,&rdquo; says Gary Unhardt, a local weatherman. &ldquo;Usually it floods only about half a mile inland, but this time it's flooded half a dozen miles inland.&rdquo; Downtown Hasiania has been completely flooded to a height of three and a half feet, and over three dozen people have been reported dead and another hundred and fifty or so are missing. &ldquo;There's never been anything like this in the entire history of Hasiania, ever,&rdquo; says Joe Regal, a local data analyst. Help has come to Hasiania from all sides of Arenztopia: The ALERT (Arenztopia nationaL Emergency Response Team) has sent 500 people and 250 search-and-rescue boats to Hasiania, and the Arenztopian Coast Guard has sent several helicopters and 100 search-and-rescue boats to scour the city. This is still a developing story; we'll publish updates in next week's paper as new facts emerge.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, one of celebrated Arenztopian painter Priscilla Selan's paintings was turned into an NFT (Nonfungible token) as a publicity stunt, sponsored by the Jupiter technology company. Titled &ldquo;Internet,&rdquo; it is a JPG ultra-realistic painting of a really fat cat eating a pizza, and it sold for 1.5 million Arenzos on Wednesday to an anonymous buyer.</p>

<p>The ASCRO stock car racing tournament continued on Tuesday and Wednesday, with legendary veteran driver Res Egaro winning race number five in car #101 and Francis Jilim winning race number six in car #40. In other sports news, the chief defensive coach Chester Oriman for the Arenztopia City Antelopes football team was fired on Thursday after being convicted of sixteen counts of money laundering by the Arenztopian Supreme Court the same day. Oriman had been given vast amounts of money from an Indonesian human-trafficking ring and he had &ldquo;laundered&rdquo; it to make it look like the money had been part of his salary. He was sentenced to life in prison with bond given at 200 million Arenzos.</p>

<p>Scientists at the University of Arenztopia in Canopia have engineered a way to make synthetic wood out of animal cells. The &ldquo;wood&rdquo; has all the properties of regular lumber, but it is made from rearranged animal cells and proteins. These findings were published in the Coast Region Journal of Science.</p>

<p>The weather should be hot and sunny for the first half of next week, with hot temperatures in the 20s Celsius. Then, on Wednesday a fairly mild cold front will blow in, lowering the temperatures to around 16-19 degrees.</p>
<h2 id="coronavirus-report">Coronavirus Report</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>On Monday, Arenztopian Officer of Health Dr. Johannes Peterson officially opened Arenztopia to all foreign travel. A number of guidelines and restrictions have been set for foreign travelers. All incoming travelers will have to quarantine for 14 days, and people arriving from high-risk countries like the US, India, and Brazil will have to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival. Any person going to Arenztopia must have proof of a negative COVID test within 48 hours of their departure, and people will need to have a negative COVID test done upon arrival in Arenztopia. If somebody tests positive for COVID before departure, they will have to wait until they test negative in order to go to Arenztopia. If somebody tests positive upon arrival in Arenztopia, they will have to quarantine until they test negative plus their base 14 or 21-day quarantine. Critics have decried these rules as too strict, but Dr. Peterson says that the stringent regulations are necessary.</p>
<h2 id="feature-okama-kimoshima">Feature: Okama Kimoshima</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Okama Kimoshima, the bestselling Japanese-Arenztopian video game developer and YouTube star. Her game studio, Nitro 246 Gaming, has made such bestselling hits as Onion Raft, a game where you build maritime vessels from cooking ingredients, and Korean Champagne, the ubiquitous 2015 strategy-based number game.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi, Okama! We are so glad to have you here at the OCA today.</p>
<p>Okama Kimoshima: Yes, I am glad to be here too! It is an honor.</p>
<p>OCA: So, to start off here, could you tell us which one of your games is your personal favorite?</p>
<p>OK: Well, one of my all-time favorites is Mincemeat, one of our earliest games from when I was still in college, in 2005. It was this little RPG thing where you would progress through a series of strategy-based obstacle courses while shooting at monsters. It was essentially a hybrid of Firebody and Watergirl and Doom. I still play it sometimes today; I personally have actually never beaten it.</p>
<p>OCA: CoolI THat souds like a very exciting game! Which one of your games has been the most successful?</p>
<p>OK: Oh, definitely Korean Champagne by a long shot. It was a really funky idea and I never really expected that it would take off, but it did. That ten-level, basic, randomly-generated idle browser game made us over one hundred thousand Arenzos. The next most successful would be The Idle Game, which made us ninety thousand Arenzos, and the third would be Onion Raft with eighty-five thousand.</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that would look like all the questions that we have for you today! Thank you so much for joining us!</p>
<p>OK: Thank you so much, again, for inviting me here!</p>

<h2 id="the-life-of-iloah-mai-arenztopias-most-successful-pacific-islander-business-owner">The Life of Iloah Mai, Arenztopia's Most Successful Pacific Islander Business Owner</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>For the next 6 issues up until our 50th issue, the OCA will take you on a immersive experience of important cultural and racial moments and stories from Arenztopians past who helped Arenztopia be what it is today. Our first story is about Iloah Mai, Arenztopia's most successful Pacific Islander business owner.</p>
<p>In 1931, in a cramped city apartment in Olb City, Iloah Mai was born to Ono and Maul Mai, two Pacific Islanders who had immigrated to Arenztopia from Samoa just one year before. Ono and Maul were one of the many Pacific Islanders who immigrated to Arenztopia in the 1920s and 30s. Iloah was one of the first Pacific Islanders to go to the University of Arenztopia at Olb City. After she graduated from business school at the age of 22, Iloah had big ambitions. She opened her first business &ldquo;I's Computer Repair&rdquo; on Main Street at 25. There, Iloah sold electronics and had a repair service ranked number 1 for electronic stores for three years straight, from 1956 to 1959, by the Arenztopia Financial Review. In 1970, she created a phone company called IL Phones, the most successful phone company in Arenztopia from 1972 to 1984. In 2009, she expanded IL Phones into the world of smartphones and created ILOS, an operating system that rivaled Apple's in terms of complexity and ubiquitousness, at least in Arenztopia. In 2015, Iloah Mai died at the age of 84, after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. Her net worth was 20 billion Arenzos at its height. Iloah's son, Nohoi Mai, continues to run both I's Computer Repair and IL Phones, which have a combined worth of 50 billion Arenzos today.</p>
<p>Iloah Mai contributed a huge amount to the technological advancements of Arenztopia. Wihout her, modern Arenztopia would not be the same. Iloah will continue to stand as one of the giants of technology in Arenztopia.</p>
<p>Iloah Sinuan Mai was instated into the Arenztopian Hall of Fame in 2020.</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>Today we recommend the excellent Five Kingdoms series by Brandon Mull. The series follows the fantastical adventures of a boy named Cole as he explores the Five Kingdoms, a magical realm full of dangers. The series is captivating, descriptive, and really just plain awesome.</p>
