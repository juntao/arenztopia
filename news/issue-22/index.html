<h2 id="plane-crashes-near-airport-hotel">Plane crashes near airport hotel</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Olb City International Airport-A Boeing 727 overshot the runway at OCIA on Monday and broke apart after hitting the ground and exploding just 50 meters from the Hilton hotel at OCIA. Police say that at least 20 people have died, 50 are injured, and the rest are missing. The wreckage of the plane was quickly doused with water and investigators are now searching for clues as to what might have caused the crash. Data obtained from the control tower at OCIA show that the airplane attempted to land on the wrong runway and that both the pilot and co-pilot were extremely inexperienced. The plane was operated by AAL, and federal authorities are now conducting an investigation into that airline company. &ldquo;This is a very unfortunate crash, and I hope this won't happen again.&rdquo; said Suhan Li, CEO of AAL. We'll be publishing a follow-up story in tomorrow's issue as new details emerge.</p>

<p>One of the arms of Hurricane Vonso barrelled into Olb City on Monday, just as predicted. It brought extreme wind and heavy rain, but only caused 2 injuries and no deaths. Heavy rains are expected to continue until Tuesday next week. The water barriers erected around several critical riverside sites held up. A stay-at-home warning is in effect until Wednesday of next week, and flash flood warnings are in place for all properties within three-quarters of a mile of the Tortoise, Anda, and Maracea rivers.</p>

<h2 id="feature-velso-morales">Feature: Velso Morales</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>We interviewed Velso Morales, the creator of Eco-Tech.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Just breifly, what is Eco-Tech?</p>
<p>Velso Morales: Eco-Tech is a tech company that focuses on ideas to help improve the planet by using eco-friendly production, and making eco-friendly products.</p>
<p>OCA: That's awesome! What is your favorite product?</p>
<p>VM: Well, I think my favorite is the E-21. It has no official name yet, but it is a tool used to clean water. You can put it in a river, pond, or lake and it will use a secret filter developed by us to filter pollution and litter out of the river. We found that it could clean a standard swimming pool in just three hours! We are still making edits to make it work even better.</p>
<p>OCA: Impressive! How do you manage to make these inventions all eco-friendly?</p>
<p>VM: We only use the parts that are completely necessary: we never have left over pieces. In the rare case that there are leftover pieces, we will use those leftover pieces for another project. Less wasted material, less pollution.</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that's all the time we have. Thanks for coming!</p>
<p>VM: Thanks for inviting me!</p>
