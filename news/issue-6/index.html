<p>Merdwif Mental Hospital-A man was analyzed by police and psycologists and deemed to have lost all reason as a result of intensive total self-isolation. The man, who is known by the name Steve Jobink, was reported to a mental hospital, the police, and a psychologist after he started to &ldquo;yell and pull his hair out&rdquo;, according to his wife. Police are investigating if there are other cases, and if so how to prevent them. Mr. Jobink was put in a straitjacket and transported to Merdwif Mental Hospital on Friday where he is under constant observation by a specially appointed team of psycologists and therapists, and the hospital's administrators say he will be ready and normal in &ldquo;less than a year&rdquo;.</p>

<p>For centuries, the valuable veins of salt in the high plains of the Tfziwrzmh have been mined for &ldquo;white gold&rdquo;. Now, historians and archaeologists have found an abandoned salt mine in the region of Aülberhassen. It was determined to be a very rare art repository from the age of the Arenztopian Revolution. However, after meticulous exploration of the mine, it was concluded that no works of art remained. Plans are being made to turn the site into a National Monument.</p>
