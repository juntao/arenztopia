<h2 id="new-dam-planned">New Dam Planned</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Shersville-On Wednesday, a new dam was announced on the Squash River about ten miles downstream from Shersville. It will be the largest dam in Arenztopia upon its completion in 2026. The dam will hold back a resovoir containing an estimated eight trillion gallons of water; the resovoir will be called Lake Shersville. The dam is a gravity dam with a length at the base of 500 feet and a height of 700 feet. The resovoir will submerge an abandoned town called Gizerh Xrgb, and Gizerh Xrgb is expected to become a hotspot for divers who want to see the abandoned and flooded city. The new dam is expected to cost six million Arenzos, and be able to control flooding and produce around 250 megawatts of energy for Shersville and other surrounding towns.</p>

<p>Artist Georgio Kanhalkanazzar unveiled another artwork at the OCAM called &ldquo;Confusion.&rdquo; It is a huge canvas with a bunch of random things pasted onto it, like a picture frame, scraps of metal and paper, and even an entire bicycle.</p>

<p>The first and second races of the ASCRO stock car racing tournament happened on Tuesday and Wednesday. Driver Chuck Garrotte in car #49 won the first race, which was held at Canopia Speedway. Driver Lars McKaulsen in car #101 won the second race, which was held at the NACircuit in New Austin. Over the course of the two races, there was one very scary crash on the famous straightaway at the NACircuit, where Greg Ino's car #38 skidded and crashed into Thandrajen Simenkar's car #98, which sent #98 careening into the inside barrier and crumpling driver-side first. #38 flipped over and briefly burst into flames; the crash forced ASCRO officials to red-flag the race, but nobody was hurt except for Simenkar, who suffered a cut on his forehead.</p>

<p>On Monday, researchers at the University of Arenztopia at Arenztopia City discovered and named a new species of beetle in the National Forest. The beetle's scientific name is Leiodes Yvvgovus, and it has a shiny black exoskeleton and a round shape. It feeds on fungi. Their findings were published in the journal Arenztopian Entomology.</p>

<h2 id="feature-emol-cofs">Feature: Emol Cofs</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Emol Cofs, the executive producer of a recently announced movie called The Haunt.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi Mrs. Cofs! Could you tell us about the new movie?</p>
<p>Emol Cofs: Well, I can't say too much! The movie will basically be about a ghost haunting a little girl's brain. The story will follow the journey of her and her friends trying to get her life back to normal. The trailer will be released on June 31st and the movie will be released on August 1st.</p>
<p>OCA: It sounds exciting! Who else is working on the movie?</p>
<p>EC: So we have, as director, Dulok Omalar: She's an extremely experienced director with two Oscar nominations and over thirty films in her portfolio. The starring role of the little girl will be played by Alice Dakota, who is a celebrated child actress. We also have Wes Kannada as producer: He's one of the most acclaimed producers in Arenztopia right now. We also have these awesome sets designed by Kumar Halin, who designed the sets for over forty-five movies and TV shows. So yeah, it's a pretty awesome cast.</p>
<p>OCA: Wow! That sounds exciting! Do you have any other details about the movie?</p>
<p>EC: Unfortunately, no, I'm not actually authorized to share any other details.</p>
<p>OCA: Well, thanks anyway for sharing all this with us! It was nice meeting you!</p>
<p>EC: Thank you!</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>Today we recommend the Calvin and Hobbes comic strips by Bill Watterson. These ran in American newspapers in the 1980s and 1990s and are available in many collections. The comic strips follow the adventures of a boy named Calvin and his talking pet tiger Hobbes. The comic strips are funny, insightful, and include many assorted shenaniagans.</p>
