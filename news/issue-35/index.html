<h2 id="new-territory-annexed">New Territory Annexed</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Choran City-A small country off the coast of Chile called the Republic of Modinau was annexed into Arenztopia on Tuesday, after money problems caused them to ask for annexation. The Republic of Modinau has now become the Modinau Region, and it has added two new cities to Arenztopia: Choran City, their former capital, and Salnez, a large fishing town. The Modinau Region encompasses the Modinau Archipelago and is made up of seven large islands and ten small islands connected by railways plus ten miles of water in either direction. The annexation of Modinau has added about 1.5 million people to Arenztopia's population, and 4 million Arenzos to its economy. Modinau has 11 mountains, 6 of which are volcanos. The largest is Mount Hakamu, at 2,500 feet. The largest city in Modinau is Choran City, which is located on Wakanalu Island. The largest island is Hoamu'an Island, at 75 miles wide and high. The longest nonstop rail line runs from Vallsen, in the northern island of Hakamu, to Korubanu'a City, on Ansoa Island. The former Prime Minister of Modinau, Ishakahn Makiki'a, says that he is grateful for the annexation. Mr. Makiki'a has immigrated to Arenztopia and become a politician in Olb City; he is the Old Region's ambassador to the Modinau Region.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a piece by the famous Japanese-Arenztopian artist Bao Mokino was sold for over 60 million Arenzos, which is a record in Arenztopia. It is an extremely intricately carved jade boulder featuring a tranquil garden scene. Mr. Mokino has used the money to buy a building in downtown Natania City, and he says that he will refurbish it and start an art school.</p>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>On Wednesday, it was declared that all professional sports players in Arenztopia had gotten vaccinated with Avac. Coach Awenhaus of the Arenztopia City Antelopes has said that he is &ldquo;extremely glad that we can play professional sports again, without any players having to worry about contracting COVID-19.&rdquo; This new development comes right at the start of football season, with the Olb City Gladiators beating the Austerfield Atomics 24-10. The Gladiators are going to face the Arenztopia City Antelopes next week.</p>

<h2 id="feature-akio-benjiro">Feature: Akio Benjiro</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>This week we interviewed 63 year old Akio Benjiro, an Arenztopian-Japanese chef whose restaraunt, Akio's Sushi (アキオの寿司), has won the Saikō No Nipponshoku (SNN) Award for best Japanese restauraunt 2 years in a row for its famous and authentic sashimi and nigiri. It serves many other dishes including boba tea, ramen, and many types of sushi roll. It is located in downtown Olb City, in Sanson Plaza.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Could you tell us a little bit about your life in Japan?</p>
<p>Akio Benjiro: Well, my home was about thirty minutes of Tokyo. It had a beautiful view of Mount Fuji. It inspired some of my decoration for my food. Every Sunday, I would drive to Tokyo and come home with many foods. I studied these foods and wrote down notes about what I liked and what I did not like while preparing them. I added many of my own ideas. After a while I wanted to start my own restaraunt. But my wife was on a vacation to Arenztopia at the time, so I traveled here to care for her. My wife got better and by then I had fallen in love with Arenztopia. We decided to stay. I still had a dream to start a restaraunt, so I bought a historic two-story building here in Olb City where me and my wife lived in a small apartment on top, and ran a restaraunt below. My restaraunt started becoming more popular and I even got a proposal from the Sanson Tower.</p>
<p>OCA: Wow! What a great story. Could you tell us about your deal with the Sanson Tower?</p>
<p>AB: Sure! The owner of the Sanson Tower, Mr. Dryheser, is a wonderful person. He offered me 200 million Arenzos to let Akio's Sushi open another location in a prime spot at the Monsai Shopping Center, located inside the Sanson Tower.</p>
<p>OCA:</p>
<p>AB:</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today, and thanks for coming!</p>
<p>AB: Thank you for inviting me! I hope you have a good day!</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>On Monday, a fire occured in East Olb City which burned a house to the ground. The fire started at about noon, and burned through to 3:00 in the morning on Tuesday. The two people in the house escaped without any injury, but their pet parrot and pet dog are believed to have died. The sides of the neighbor's houses were heavily charred, but repairable. Over 500,000 Arenzos in compensation have been paid to the burned house's residents and their neighbors. The cause of the fire was revealed to be a gas leak.</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>This week we recommend the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It is a wonderful book about Catniss Everdeen and the country of Panam, set in a dystopian world where people are forced to fight to the death. If you like fiction books about dystopia, this is a book for you.</p>
