<h2 id="fatal-car-crash">Fatal Car Crash</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>AR-10-On Tuesday, a fatal car crash occured on AR-10, which involved two semi trucks and a sedan, and killed 3 people. According to footage, one of the semi trucks seems to have accidentally swerved into the wrong lane, but when the driver realized the mistake, he tried to swerve into the lane that he was in before. The semi truck ran over a sedan that was in its path, and another semi truck was hit by the first semi truck's  trailer as it fell over. After the first semi truck hit the sedan, it flipped over and burst into flames, revealing the crushed sedan. The sedan exploded as well a couple of minutes later, and the explosion flung it into a ditch in the side of the road. The second semi truck flipped over and was partially crushed.</p>

<h2 id="feature-chris-sanders">Feature: Chris Sanders</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>We interveiwed Chris Sanders, a famous author and poet who recently released a book of poems.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: What are your poems and writings usually about?</p>
<p>Chris Sanders: So my poems, they're easy to read and they deal with real events that are happening right now. I know that people are sometimes turned away by the philosophical poems that they usually see, so I want to make poetry that is at once beautiful and accessible. As for my writing, whenever I see something interesting, I write about it.</p>
<p>OCA: Can you tell us about your new book?</p>
<p>CS: Sure! So it's titled &ldquo;Chasing Dreams&rdquo;, and it's just a collection of my poems about dreams and what I think dreams mean.</p>
<p>OCA: That sounds interesting! Can you give us an excerpt of one of the poems in the book?</p>
<p>CS: (laughs) I don't actually remember any of the poems in there, I'm so sorry. (laughs)</p>
<p>OCA: It's alright, everybody is forgetful sometimes. Anyway, those are the questions that we have for you today, and thank you for coming!</p>
<p>CS: Thanks for inviting me!</p>
