<p>The Sculptor's Association of Arenztopia (SAA) announced its dissolution on Thursday, after a scandal which caused the resignment of prominent artists like Bao Mokino, Moe Kinakshi, Miekl Kyonankii, and others. The CEO of the association, a classical-style artist named Sinclair Yindranishikan, was found to be a member of the Classicist Revolutionaries, which attacked Miekl Kyonankii's studio a couple months ago (See <a href="https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-24/">Issue 24</a>). Due to his endorsement of the Classicist Revolutionaries, Yindranishikan had broke the SAA's rules against prejudice. In addition, Yindranishikan was among the people found guilty of breaking and entering into Kyonankii's studio. He was sentenced to a year in jail.</p>

<p>Welcome to our new Science column! In it, we will report science news from around Arenztopia.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, researchers at Olb University successfully demonstrated an experimental rocket engine being developed for the ASA. They fitted it onto a General Rocketry 118 rocket and launched it from Indanburg Air Force Base near New Austin. The rocket reached 115 miles in altitude and made 20 orbits before making a controlled reentry over the Arenztopian desert. The ASA said that the test was a success, and that they may be attempting to launch a satellite using the engine next month.</p>

<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>Cases remain at zero, with vaccinations slowing. About 41,000,000 people have been vaccinated, with nine million still to go. Many of those nine million are children, because Avac has not been approved for children 16 and under. Dr. Johannes Peterson, the Officer of Health, has ordered around a million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, which has been approved for children 12 and over.</p>

<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Minoshi Conaway, a racecar driver for ASCRO car #33, sponsored by Kaiath Systems. #33 was involved in a huge and famous crash at Olb Speedway in 2018, where Conaway lost control of his car and did a barrel roll, crashing into and setting several other cars on fire. Two people were killed in the crash and it led to a reform of the ASCRO rules.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hello! To start off, can you tell us a bit about the famous crash in 2018?</p>
<p>Minoshi Conaway: Sure! So I clearly remember that the crash was very sudden, because one moment I was pulling into the lead and then the next moment my car was spinning and on fire, right? So my first</p>
