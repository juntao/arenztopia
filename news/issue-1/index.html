<h2 id="gold-mine-found">Gold Mine Found!</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan and Clint Lee</p>
<p>West AM District-On Tuesday, an ancient gold mine was found in the district of West AM, known to locals as West-A-Mountain district. The gold mine was discovered by Jack Peterson, a native resident, when he was volunteering to pick up trash. Says Mr. Peterson, &ldquo;I was walking around, minding my own buisiness, when I spotted a large hole in the hillside. I peeked in, and something shiny caught my eye.&rdquo; Mr. Peterson immediatly called the ASO (Arenzish Scientific Office), and on Thursday the mine was revealed to be one of the biggest mines in Arenztopia´s history. Experts estimate that there could be about 500 karats of high-quality gold in the giant cavern. It is still a mystery why the miners abandoned the prosperous mine. Sadly, on Friday the mine collaped as a result of damp ground, and killed 50 people as well as 3 children. Rescuers rescued 28 more people from suffocation.</p>

<p>by Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>On Saturday, a rare book was discovered among the millions of manuscripts kept in the Olb City National Library. It is a copy of the book &ldquo;Bottles of Blood&rdquo;, which recounts the entire Arenztopian Revolution as told from the view of a young American soldier. The book was a flop, and the only two copies ever made were in this person's handwriting.<br>
&ldquo;Lined up on the shelves were bottles of blood, bottles of blood, bottles of blood.&rdquo;
