<h2 id="explosion-occurs-on-sanson-towers-top-floor">Explosion occurs on Sanson Tower's top floor</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Sanson Tower-On Monday, a large explosion occured on the Sanson Tower's 96th floor, injuring two people, and raining glass and metal onto Sanson Plaza down below. Some of the debris also injured 3 people total on the 76th, 44th, and 21st floors. Three other people were injured in the plaza, making for a total injury count of 6 people. Nobody was killed. The explosion started a fire which burnt through the 96th, 95th, and part of the 94th floors after firefighters arrived on the scene and quenched the blaze. The explosion was discovered to be the cause of a faulty electrical box on the roof. The Sanson Tower is currently being repaired, and McMillery√©ge &amp; Sons, the contractors which built the tower, have paid off all the costs associated with the accident and are also inspecting the building for other dangers.</p>
