<h2 id="feature-christansen-redfield">Feature: Christansen Redfield</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>We interviewed Christansen Redfield, who is the Dean of Accounting at Arenztopia University at Olb City, or AUOC. He caught COVID-19 in March, and was brought back from a seemingly hopeless situation.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: So, uh, tell us a little bit about yourself.</p>
<p>Christansen Redfield: I am an immigrant from Finland. I moved here back in the 1990s. I became a lawyer, and I became the Dean of Accounting in 2018. And that's uh, that's me!</p>
<p>OCA: Well, so we all know your story. You were in the ICU for a month, on the brink of death. Then, within two days, you were up and running again. Could you elaborate on the beginning of tht story? I say the beginning because your story is probably gonna be pretty long.</p>
<p>CR: Ok, so here it goes: I probably caught the coronavirus from a birthday party I went to, back in February when nobody really thought about the coronavirus; I was on a trip to visit my cousins in China. So after that, I began to show symptoms, and this was in early March, where I was back in Arenztopia. And then the pandemic was declared a pandemic. So I was like, &lsquo;Well, maybe this is COVID&rsquo;, and I went to my doctor, and he looked me over, patted me on the back, and said that it was &lsquo;unlikely&rsquo; to be COVID. So then I'm like, I just have a cold, or the flu maybe. So I had better stay away from people. So I did, I told people with questions to email me, and I stayed away from [AUOC]. So pretty much at that point I was under house arrest (laughs), basically.</p>
<p>OCA: And then continue your story.</p>
<p>CR: And then the symptoms started worsening very quick, very fast, and I went to the hospital at AUOC, and they said, &lsquo;You have COVID-19&rsquo;, and I was like, oh, ok. So I was admitted to the ICU a couple days later, this is in April or June, and it truly, truly felt like I was being pushed underwater and forced to breathe, like, my lungs felt full of goo, and I was literally gasping for air. And the rest is history.</p>
<p>OCA: So, uh, why do you think, personally, that you miraculously survived?</p>
<p>CR: Well, I think the one half of it was the doctors; they were working on shifts 24/7 and many of them worked 10-hour days; but they kept persevering and every one of them gave their all. They gave me pretty much the best COVID-19 care that I could have gotten in Olb City.</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that's it! Thank's for sharing your story with us!</p>
<p>CR: Thank you! Bye!</p>
