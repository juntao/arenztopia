<h2 id="building-demolished">Building Demolished</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>220 Main Street-On Monday, a 34-story building on Main Street was demolished. The building was built in 1973 in the retrofuturism style. It used to house offices for Atlantic Cinemas, but after Atlantic shut down in 2004, the building was abandoned. The building had many rounded shapes, circular portholes, curves, and chrome. It was renovated in 2009 and used as offices for AOA Realty, before AOA also shut down in 2019.</p>

<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Meilleur GÃ¢teau Acel, owner of Acel's Bakery in New Paris. It achieved some degree of fame in the cooking community on Monday when it won the coveted 1st place award on the French baking competition show GPF. Mr. Acel is also known for his famous 2013 deal with Dripping Cone, in which he became the first small business to collaborate with the ice cream giant.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi! Thanks for coming! Could you tell us a bit about the history of your bakery?</p>
<p>Meilleur Acel: Sure! So it all started when my grandmother decided to open a bakery in New Paris, after she had immigrated there from France in the 1950s. She was a truly amazing chef! Whenever I wandered past the kitchen while she was cooking, she would drag me over and show me how to bake bread from scratch, weather I wanted to have a cooking lesson or not. Unfortunately, my grandmother passed away when I was 13, and from then on my mom taught me. My dad had passed away of cancer only two months before I was born, so we donate 25% of our bakery's profits to cancer research at the Department of Medicine at Arenztopia University.</p>
<p>OCA: I am so sorry for your losses, could you tell us a bit about your famous deal with Dripping Cone?</p>
<p>MA:</p>
<p>OCA:</p>
<p>MA:</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions we have for you today! Thank you for coming!</p>
<p>MA: Thank you for inviting me!</p>

<h2 id="mummy-tomb-found">Mummy Tomb Found</h2>
<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>On Tuesday, famous archaeologist Ishaan P. discovered a tomb built in the Ancient Egyptian style hidden underneath the Arenztopian Desert. The tomb contained two mummies, a room with many expensive books, and another, hidden room with over 5 million Arenzos worth of gold. The mummies are believed to be that of a wealthy Arenztopian landowner named Abasi Adel and his wife. They famously requested to be mummified in 1924 at the height of the European mummy craze. Abasi had his mummy buried in a previously secret location known only to him, his wife, and the contracting company employed to dig it.</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>Today we recommend the excellent article &ldquo;I Recommend Eating Chips&rdquo; by Sam Anderson for the New York Times. It is funny and amplifies the experience of eating chips into a true literary masterpiece. You can read it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/magazine/i-recommend-eating-chips.html">here</a>, but you'll have to bypass the paywall somehow.</p>
