<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Olb City Convention Center-On Tuesday, the auction house Stansberry virtually auctioned off many items. One of the most expensive objects was a super-rare 1918 Arenz Motors Simile, which sold for over 300,000 Arenzos.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.esprit-de-france.com/sites/esprit-de-france.com/files/styles/article_header_943x420/public/article/ventes_aux_encheres_1_0.jpg?itok=Sm4_EGtW" alt="A typical Stansberry private auction."> <br>

<h2 id="feature-jack-ma">Feature: Jack Ma</h2>
<p>by Tony Yuan</p>
<p>We interviewed Jack Ma, the richest person in China and the owner of Ant Group, which is a subsidiary of his company Alibaba. Ant Group has announced its intentions to start a massive, 626 billion Arenzo IPO sometime next week.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: So tell us a little bit about your upcoming IPO.</p>
<p>Jack Ma: So first I want to tell people what an IPO is. It's an event where a company goes public, basically. So what everybody means by biggest IPO is that Ant Group is going to be worth the most money when it goes public.</p>
<p>OCA: What are the potential implications of this IPO?</p>
<p>JM: So first, it would add a lot more value to the Chinese stock market. Also, it would hopefully make Ant Group or ALibaba grow in size through trading.</p>
<p>OCA: What are you planning to do with all the extra money, if there is any?</p>
<p>JM: I want to give it to small buisenesses; they're the ones who need it the mot, espcially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>OCA: Thanks! That's all for today. Thanks for coming!</p>
<p>JM: Thank you!</p>
