<h2 id="huge-lawsuit-filed">Huge Lawsuit Filed</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Olb City Courthouse-On Monday, Demial Kondo filed a lawsuit against his partner Bedli Amat. Both are millionaires and jointly own the massive company KandaRestauraunts Holdings Company, Inc. which has a net worth of 100 billion dollars and owns such chains like Jamaisvu, the famous fine dining store, and large stakes in McDonalds. Kondo accused Amat of fraud, verbal abuse of employees, theft of employee's salaries, and more. Demial also says that Amat has been crediting himself with owning and founding the entire company even though he only owns 65% of it. Research by the judges also found that Amat had not founded the company: He had joined Kondo two years aftter the company was formed. Employee testimony states that Amat was extremely rude to them and insulted them often; he also stole employee salaries without explanation. A jury sentenced Amat to 15 years in jail, as well as a 650,000 Arenzo fine. The government gave his holdings in the company to Kondo.</p>
