<h2 id="huge-lawsuit-filed">Huge Lawsuit Filed</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Olb City Courthouse-On Monday, Demial Kondo filed a lawsuit against his partner Bedli Amat. Both are millionaires and jointly own the massive company KandaRestauraunts Holdings Company, Inc. which has a net worth of 100 billion dollars and owns such chains like Jamaisvu, the famous fine dining store, and large stakes in McDonalds. Kondo accused Amat of fraud, verbal abuse of employees, theft of employee's salaries, and more. Demial also says that Amat has been crediting himself with owning and founding the entire company even though he only owns 65% of it. Research by the judges also found that Amat had not founded the company: He had joined Kondo two years aftter the company was formed. Employee testimony states that Amat was extremely rude to them and insulted them often; he also stole employee salaries without explanation. A jury sentenced Amat to 15 years in jail, as well as a 650,000 Arenzo fine. The government gave his holdings in the company to Kondo.</p>

<h2 id="feature-kanollan-shinkharin">Feature: Kanollan Shinkharin</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Kanollan Shinkharin, the CEO and founder of Kor, which is a plane company.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Thank you so much for coming! To start off, could you tell us a bit about some of the planes that Kor makes?</p>
<p>Kanollan Shinkharin: Sure! So Kor makes private jets, to put it simply. We are in direct competition with Embraer for control of the Arenztopian private jet market right now. We charge 8 million Arenzos to buy, which is very cheap in the private jet sector, and we charge 10,000 Arenzos per hour to charter a large jet and 5,000 Arenzos per hour to charter a small one. Our most luxurious jet is the Kor 900, which is 98 feet long. It has leather upholstery, 4K OLED touchscreen TVs, a Kor T-0 eight-screen Super Cockpit Suite, two twin-size beds, four turbojet engines, and more.</p>
<p>OCA: That does sound very luxurious! What is the newest private jet that Kor has made?</p>
<p>KS: Well, the newest jet that we have made is actually our smallest, the Kor 200 Mk 2. It's a rerelease of the Kor 200, and the Mk 2 was released just a month ago. It can seat five people with leather upholstery and 4k HD TVs, and it is powered by two turboprop engines.</p>
<p>OCA:</p>
<p>KS:</p>
<p>OCA: Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today! Thank you for coming!</p>
<p>KS: Thank you for inviting me! It was nice meeting you!</p>
