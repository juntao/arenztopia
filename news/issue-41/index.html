<h2 id="underwater-city-planned">Underwater City Planned</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>The contractor company Alsburg Contractors is announcing a massive and ambitious underwater city called Verre D'eau. The city has been designed to minimize impact on the surrounding wildlife. It will feature 13 pressurized domes spead out over the seafloor, and each dome will be 100 feet tall, have two layers, be held up by metal trusses, and be made from 1-inch thick sheets of Plexiglass. The domes will contain three areas for housing, 2 for science and education, two restaurant and shopping areas, two grocery store areas, and one central dome for government offices and a town square. All of this will house 25,000 residents and over 550 businesses. Alsburg has placed an order for 50 large Njord 2901 MK III submarines at a cost of 50 million Arenzos to use as public transportation, and each dome will have 4 airlocks to use as docking places and garages for these submarines. Pressurized pedestrian tunnels are being dug underneath the seabed for people who want to walk. There will be daily shuttles to Arenztopia City. Verre D'eau is expected to be finished in late 2031 at a cost of about 1 trillion Arenzos. &ldquo;This is completely unexplored territory,&rdquo; says Dr. Brian Gainsbourough, a scientist at the University of Arenztopia. &ldquo;Nobody's ever tried anything even remotely like this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fonger Allemester, a sculptor from the city of New Austin, sold his most famous sculpture &ldquo;La Pluie&rdquo; for 100 million Arenzos on Tuesday. The sculpture is in the abstractionist style. There is a blue cube, which represents the rain, and a Cubism-style torch underneath. The work shows the torch being blown out by the rain.</p>

<p>In Modinau, the Choran City Cod are facing off next Tuesday against the Salnez Sea Snakes in the first match of the Modinau National Soccer Championships. You can tune in by searching &ldquo;MNSC&rdquo; on Youtube or tuning your cable TV to frequency 100.9.</p>
<h2 id="science">Science</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>On Tuesday, scientists at Olb University discovered a new type of virus called AOIVD-21, which stands for Arenztopia-Originated Intramuscular Viral Disease 2021. It has not been recorded in humans, but trials with mice and flies find that the virus spreads quickly and causes muscle spasms and seizures. &ldquo;I have absolutely no idea why this hasn't been seen in humans yet, because all the signs say that it should have spread to humans by now,&rdquo; says Dr. Albert McPhillips, one of the researchers who discovered AOIVD-21. The researchers have published their findings in the journal Arenztopia Science.</p>

<p>Next week will be clear skies and an average of around 25 degrees Celsius until Tuesday, at which point a cold front will roll in and the temperature will drop to 15 degrees with cloudy skies and a 5% chance of rain for the rest of the week.</p>
<h2 id="coronavirus-report">Coronavirus Report</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>Cases have remained at 0. The 1 million doses of Pfizer vaccine (See <a href="https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-40/">Issue 40</a>) have been delivered, and they have all been administered to childen ages 12 to 16, raising the vaccination caount to about 42,000,000 people. Doctors in Arenztopia are still racing to create a child version of Avac; the most promising one appears to be the KidVac vaccine being developed by government scientists in cooperation with the University of Arenztopia: It's shown 90% efficacy in baby monkeys.</p>
<h2 id="feature-makena-doloa">Feature: Makena DoLoa</h2>
<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, the owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plant nursery. DoLoa Plants has been running for over 50 years, and it is known across the arborist world for its high quality and low prices.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! To start off, could you tell us your favorite plant?</p>
<p>Makena DoLoa: So I really, really, really like the White Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.</p>
<p>OCA: That sounds like a nice flower! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist?</p>
<p>MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though I did not do anything.</p>
<p>OCA: That does sound difficult. How much does each plant cost?</p>
<p>MD: Well, they range in prices with the most expensive being our rare flowers and large trees at about 1000 Arenzos. The least expensive are our succulents, at about 5 to 10 Arenzos.</p>
<p>OCA: Cool! Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today!</p>
<p>MD: Thanks for having me!</p>

<h2 id="huge-law-battle-within-the-ang">Huge law battle within the ANG</h2>
<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>The AMG (Arenztopian Media Group) has been divided recently over who the group's rightful owner is. Founder Thompson McRae has been challenged by board member Lenskial Omin. Both have marshalled huge armies of lawyers and each side has presented equally convincing evidence; they are due to go to a grand jury next Wednesday. We will publish updates as new facts emerge.</p>
<h2 id="akios-sushi-merging-with-taiwan-tea">Akio's Sushi merging with Taiwan Tea</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>The famous local sushi shop Akio's Sushi is merging with Taiwan Tea, a traditional boba tea shop. The owner of Akio's Sushi, Akio Benjiro, has booked a spot for another location of his shop in the city of Verre D'eau (See cover story), and since the rent is very high in Verre D'eau, Akio has merged his company with Taiwan Tea to earn more money.</p>
<h2 id="book-recommendation">Book Recommendation</h2>
<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>Today we reccomend the amazing and hilarious book Thing Explainer by Randall Munroe. It explains complicated things like tectonic plates, the periodic table, microwaves, and more using only the 1000 most used words in the English language. The ridiculously funny text is accompanied by illustrations demonstrating how to disassemble a computer so that you can look inside, how not to use a telescope, and much more.</p>
