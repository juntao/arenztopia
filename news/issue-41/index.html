<p>ANG, The Arenzish News Group, is in the middle of a heated court case. Founder of the group, Onytay Unyay has been accused by Orzolay Vilay for falsely taking credit of the company. Orzolay, presented many pieces of evididence that prove he was the founder of the company. Ontay, refuses to give over the company and asks for more evidence. The court has decided that Orzolay will be given ownership of the company, as well as 5.2 Million AZ. Onytay, lacked any evidence he started the company. 1 person on jury duty called it &ldquo;Embarrassing, he kept asking for evidence even after it had been provided, and he was not even capable of providing his own evidence when asked.&rdquo; Anonymous employees, said Onytay stole their ideas and took credit for them.</p>

<p>Fonger Allemester, sculptor from the city of New Austin, recently sold his most famous sculpture &ldquo;La Pluie&rdquo; for 100 Million Arenzos. The sculpture is an abstract.

<p>On Tuesday, scientists at Olb University discovered a new type of virus called AOIVD-21, which stands for Arenztopia-Originated Intramuscular Viral Disease 2021. It has not been recorded in humans, but trials with mice and flies find that the virus spreads quickly and causes muscle spasms and seizures. &ldquo;I have absolutely no idea why this hasn't been seen in humans yet, because all the signs say that it should have spread to humans by now,&rdquo; says Dr. Albert McPhillips, one of the researchers who discovered AOIVD-21. The researchers have published their findings in the journal Arenztopia Science.</p>

<p>By Lorenzo Avila &amp; Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, the owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plant nursery. DoLoa Plants has been running for over 50 years, and it is known across the arborist world for its high quality and low prices.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! To start off, could you tell us your favorite plant?</p>
<p>Makena DoLoa: So I really, really, really like the White Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.</p>
<p>OCA: That sounds like a nice flower! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist?</p>
<p>MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though I did not do anything.</p>
<p>OCA: That does sound difficult. How much does each plant cost?</p>
<p>MD: Well, they range in prices with the most expensive being our rare flowers and large trees at about 1000 Arenzos. The least expensive are our succulents, at about 5 to 10 Arenzos.</p>
<p>OCA: Cool! Well, that looks like all the questions that we have for you today!</p>
<p>MD: Thanks for having me!</p>

<p>A new underwater city,  Verre D'eau, is being built this moment. The new city will offer 3 different neighborhoods, multiple grocery stores, jobs, as well as food. The city will have a population of 25,000. The city will be made of a glass like material called GL. They will be connected by water passage ways, with a submarine type public transportation. The town center, will have a town hall, and a bell. It will be located under the pristine blue watters of Arenztopia. Contractors have made it so in no way will any wildlife be affected. You will be able to acces Arenztopia City, on an hourly submarine. Jobs will be well paying as the rest of Arenztopia is, and housing will be average Arenzish housing.
