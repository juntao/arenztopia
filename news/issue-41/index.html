<p>Today we interviewed Makena DoLoa, famous owner of DoLoa Plants, a high quality plants seller.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi Makena! What is your favorite plant?</p>
<p>Makena DoLoa: Hi! I really like the white Dahlia. It is so sophisticatedly beautiful. Also, it is not incredibly hard to grow.</p>
<p>OCA: Sounds pretty! Could you tell us the hardest part of being an arborist.</p>
<p>MD: Well, I think it is when customers get mad, which happens a lot. When they don't take very good care of it and it dies, they get mad at me even though i did not do anything.</p>
<p>OCA: That does sound diffucult. How much does each plant cost?</p>
<p>MD: Well they range in prices with the most expensive being our fig trees, with the least being our artificil succulents.</p>
<p>OCA: Cool! That's all the questions we had, thanks for coming!</p>
<p>MD: Thanks for having me!</p>

<p>A new underwater city,  Verre D'eau, is being built this moment. The new city will offer 3 different neighborhoods, multiple grocery stores, jobs, as well as food.

The town center, will have a town hall, and a bell. It will be located under the pristine blue watters of Arenztopia. Contractors have made it so in no way will any wildlife be affected. You will be able to acces Arenztopia City, on an hourly submarine. Jobs will be well paying as the rest of Arenztopia is, and housing will be average Arenzish housing.
