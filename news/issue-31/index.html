<h2 id="explosion-at-cargo-port">Explosion at Cargo Port</h2>
<p>By Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Tortoise River Freight Port-A huge explosion rocked the Tortoise River Freight Port on Tuesday. The Tortoise River Freight Port is a major port on the Tortoise River about 30 miles downstream from Olb City, at a place where the Tortoise River expands to 1000 feet. It is the output for most of the freight that is exported from Olb City. The explosion is estimated to have a blast force of 400 tons of TNT, and it destroyed ten containers and badly scorched a nearby cargo ship. The explosion killed one worker and injured two others, and it is estimated to have damaged or destroyed over 2 million Arenzos worth of cargo. Officials have quickly mobilized an investigation team. The cause of the explosion is still undetermined. We will be publishing updates as new facts emerge.</p>

<h2 id="coronavirus-report-deaths-are-at-zero">Coronavirus Report: Deaths are at zero!</h2>
<p>By Owen Miyazoi</p>
<p>Cases have dropped even lower to 140, and deaths have dropped to ZERO for the first time since March 1st. Avac vaccination drives have increased greatly to over 500,000 people vaccinated this week. Pfizer vaccinations are at 5,500. All 5,500 Pfizer vaccinations are second shots, for a total of 523,575 fully vaccinated people. The Arenztopian Officer of Health, Dr. Johannes Peterson, says that the 20,000 doses of Moderna vaccine (see <a href="https://www.arenztopia.com/news/issue-28/">Issue 28</a>) will be coming next week. Dr. Peterson has also said that a fresh shipment of 20,000 Pfizer vaccine doses will come next week as well, as the second replenishment shipment to Arenztopia. (The first one was delivered in secret to prevent theft.) These replenishment shipments are partially funded by the COVAX program.</p>

<p>By Lorenzo Avila and Tony Yuan</p>
<p>Today we interviewed Azaria Viotto, an Italian-Arenztopian scientist working on many things COVID related. She is here to talk to us for our one year of COVID special feature.</p>
<p>Olb City Announcer: Hi Azaria! Can you tell us about your job?</p>
<p>Azaria Viotto: Yeah! My job is very simple: Just research COVID, find ways to prevent people from getting COVID, and to make the vaccine accesible.</p>
<p>OCA: Cool! How many vaccines are you hoping to distribute this year?</p>
<p>AV: Well, we are hoping to have distributed 2 million doses by June, and we're on course to accomplish that!</p>
<p>OCA: So I've also heard that you work as a doctor, can you tell us a bit about that?</p>
<p>AV: Yes, I do work as I doctor, I have a MD in Medicine from the University of Arenztopia at Arenztopia City. I work as a senior nurse at Olb City Central Hospital (OCCH). In the pandemic, I have been administering vaccine shots and working in the ICU, as well as managing the vaccine-distribution project at the OCCH.</p>
<p>OCA: That's really cool! Thank you so much for coming!</p>
<p>AV: Thank you for inviting me, ciao!</p>

<p>By Sam-Louis Alrocaet</p>
<p>On Monday, Kanlaln Narecaussus, the CEO of AZ Scoops, was convicted after his company lost the court case against Dripping Cone. The trial was presided by famous judge Marlo Minns. AZ Scoops presented their recipes, which looked markedly different from Dripping Cone's but were later revealed to be falsified. Dripping Cone presented security camera footage from one of their factories that showed an unidentified figure breaking into an office and stealing recipes. The figure was wearing an AZ Scoops badge. Kanlaln Narecaussus was sentenced to 25 years in jail for eight counts of stealing, six counts of fraud, three counts of participating in fraud, one count of breaking and entering, and five counts of lying before the court.</p>
